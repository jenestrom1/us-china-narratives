Blinken                               \\nSecretary of State \\nU.S. Department of State \\n2201 C Street, N.W. \\nWashington, D.C. 20520 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Honorable Samantha Power \\nAdministrator of United States Agency for International Development \\nU.S. Agency for International Development \\n1300 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. \\nWashington, DC 20004 \\nDear Secretary Blinken and Administrator Power:  \\nWe write today to express our concern that diplomats and other employees of the State \\nDepartment and USAID working abroad are being routinely denied access to reproductive \\nhealthcare. Nearly a year ago, you received a letter from more than 200 State and USAID \\nemployees decrying the lack of consistent access to reproductive healthcare available to \\nemployees working overseas. Specifically, women employees raised concerns over inconsistent \\navailability of: (1) rape kits; (2) family planning services, including emergency contraceptives \\nand medical abortion; and (3) access to trained professionals, including obstetrician-\\ngynecologists. We seek to gain clarity on how you plan to remedy this situation.  \\nWe applaud the Biden administration\\u2019s commitments to ensuring women\\u2019s rights and access to \\nreproductive healthcare. In the first National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, the Biden \\nadministration asserted: \\u201cHealth care is a right\\u2014not a privilege. All people deserve access to \\nhigh-quality, affordable healthcare\\u2026we will...promote access to sexual and reproductive health \\nand rights both at home and abroad.\\u201d We struggle to reconcile the National Strategy\\u2019s vision \\nwith the experience of women working for the State Department and USAID who are asked to \\ncarry out the important objectives of that strategy and yet lack access to adequate reproductive \\nhealthcare themselves. We urge you to take immediate action to effectuate the policies outlined \\nin this strategy. \\nWomen working in U.S. embassies, missions, and consulates abroad deserve reliable access to \\nhealthcare\\u2014including reproductive healthcare. We urge you to guarantee their right to such care \\nby updating the policies and procedures that govern the operations of the State Department and \\nUSAID, including by codifying the right to reproductive healthcare into the Foreign Affairs \\nManual. We are also concerned by reports that employees who experience sexual assault or rape \\nwhile serving overseas may not have access to reproductive health services and other appropriate \\ncare. Clearly, post-sexual assault care is essential healthcare, and so should be available to every \\nperson working for the U.S. Government overseas. \\nWhile we are aware that the State Department and USAID have launched a Women\\u2019s Health \\nWorking Group, we seek to better understand how these inequities will be adequately addressed. \\nTo that end, we ask that you answer the following questions by February 6, 2023:   \\n1. What new resources have the State Department and USAID committed to address \\nongoing concerns that women employees have inequitable access to healthcare services \\nabroad?  \\n2. How will post-sexual assault and post-rape care be incorporated into these efforts to \\nensure anyone who is sexually assaulted overseas while working under chief of mission \\nauthority has access to appropriate healthcare? What efforts are being made to train \\nappropriate staff in responding to reports of sexual assault or rape? \\n3. What actions will you be taking in the next six months to guarantee women access to \\nreproductive healthcare while working overseas? Will those actions include making the \\nnecessary updates to the Foreign Affairs Manual?  \\n4. What is your timeline for permanently institutionalizing the right to reproductive \\nhealthcare access in your policies and procedures?  \\nWe firmly believe that women working for the State Department and USAID abroad are \\nessential to advancing U.S. foreign policy objectives. It is critical\\u2014both for their well-being and \\nfor the mission of these agencies\\u2014that women employees of the State Department and USAID \\nbe provided access to adequate healthcare.

CORY A. BOOKER \\nU.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY \\nSenator BOOKER. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee hear-\\ning will come to order now. \\nI cannot tell you how excited I am. We have an extraordinary \\ngroup of people who have dedicated their lives to public service \\nfolks who are so talented they have many other options. \\nEach and every one of you sitting before me and the ranking \\nmember right now are defining patriotism in the sense of your will-\\ningness to sacrifice in the name of service to country and I greet \\nyou in that spirit and I am very excited. \\nThis is not just a perfunctory process. This is a celebration of \\nwhat we are about as a country a country run by our citizens who \\nstep forward to serve in difficult times. \\nI am honored to be here today next to Senator Rounds a ranking \\nmember who gives me great confidence and hope for our Senate to \\nbe able to actually function and I am sure this is going to be a very \\nfunctional hearing. \\nI want to just jump right in. The five people before us right now \\nare Nathaniel Fick who is to be the Ambassador at Large for \\nCyberspace and Digital Policy. I am so happy that we are looking \\nat cyberspace and digital policy and having someone up to lead \\nthat. We thank the President for that nomination. \\nWe also have Mr. Michael Schiffer to be Assistant Administrator \\nfor Asia and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) \\nand we are very excited about that. \\nPerhaps at this point there should be a hush in the crowd be-\\ncause we are about to introduce someone from New Jersey. I want \\nto introduce Ms. Rachna Korhonen who is from of course the Gar-\\nden State to be Ambassador to the Republic of Mali. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00001\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6601\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n2 \\nAnd then we have Lucy\\u2014Ms. Lucy Tamlyn to be Ambassador to \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and finally Ms. Jessica \\nDavis Ba to be Ambassador to the Republic of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nAnd I am very happy to see\\u2014some of you have already seen one \\nof my favorite people in the United States Senate Senator Angus \\nKing from Maine.

I \\nknow that we are in one of the most demanding weeks in the \\nUnited States Senate. So after your remarks no one will look \\naskance at you if you leave and duck out. \\nYou are recognized. \\nSTATEMENT OF HON. ANGUS KING \\nU.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE \\nSenator KING. Senator thank you very much. \\nI was excited when you said I was one of your favorite people. \\nBut then you qualified by saying in the United States Senate. \\n[Laughter.] \\nSenator KING. So that narrowed it somewhat substantially. \\nI am delighted to be with you this morning and to introduce Nate \\nFick. But I want to begin by a little bit of a description of the office \\nthat he is going to be taking and how important it is. \\nAs you and the Vice Chair know I worked for several years on \\ncybersecurity policy for this country as part of the Cyberspace So-\\nlarium Commission. \\nOne of our principal recommendations was the creation of an of-\\nfice or a bureau in the State Department to deal with international \\nissues relating to cyber and they can be anything from coordinating \\ninternational response to a cyber attack to establishing norms and \\nstandards in cyberspace\\u2014a kind of Geneva Convention of cyber\\u2014 \\nand also participating in international panels that set standards \\nfor the internet that frankly this country has not been as active \\nin as we should be. \\nThis recommendation has been turned into something called the \\nCyber Diplomacy Act which has passed the House and is going to \\nbe considered in the near future by this committee. \\nI commend it to you as an urgent piece of legislation. What it \\ndoes is codify the concept of an office within the office of the State \\nDepartment to confront and deal with these issues. \\nThe idea is we want someone who gets up every morning think-\\ning about the international ramifications of cyber and that is what \\nthis office will do. \\nMr. Fick has been appointed to head a bureau of cyber policy in \\nthe State Department. But this is a creation of the Administration. \\nI commend the Administration for taking the initiative to create \\nthis office within the State Department. But I believe we also need \\nlegislation to codify the existence of the office so it is not something \\nthat may come and go with the whim of a particular Administra-\\ntion. \\nSo you are going to be seeing the Cyber Diplomacy Act. I believe \\nit was scheduled originally for today. It has been postponed be-\\ncause of the NATO activity this afternoon. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00002\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6601\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n3 \\nBut I hope that you will give prompt consideration to that bill. \\nIt has been\\u2014has a lot of work gone into it and I look forward to \\nworking with you on it hopefully prompt enactment. \\nLet me introduce Nate Fick. He is from Maine. \\n[Laughter.] \\nSenator KING. Oh sorry. Oh yeah there are some other things. \\nActually if you took a blank sheet of paper and tried to design \\na person to fit this new position you would have come up with \\nsomeone of Nate Fick\\u2019s extraordinary qualifications and back-\\nground. \\nA Marine\\u2014I made the mistake once of calling Senator Roberts \\na former Marine. He informed me there is no such thing as a \\nformer Marine. If you are a Marine you are a Marine. \\nAnd he served in Iraq and Afghanistan later served as the CEO \\nof a nonprofit Center for New American Security at which time \\nhe dealt with issues of cyber and international ramifications of \\ncyber. \\nHe then has worked in the private sector as the CEO of a soft-\\nware company\\u2014again involved in issues of cyber. He has a degree \\nin policy from the Kennedy School and also business from the Har-\\nvard Business School. Immensely well qualified very thoughtful \\nengaged in this issue and I think as I said I cannot imagine a \\nbetter candidate to fulfill this position and the fact that he is from \\nthe state of Maine is simply gravy. \\nBut Mr. Chairman I commend Nathan Fick to you and I apolo-\\ngize I do have to go off to a hearing of the Rules Committee on \\nthe Electoral Count Act which is a matter of some concern to all \\nof us. \\nI appreciate your courtesy this morning and I look forward to \\nworking with the committee to advance this nomination. \\nThank you. \\nSenator BOOKER.

The spirit \\nof Joshua Chamberlain one of the greatest American heroes who \\nhappens to be from Maine is looking down upon the two of you \\nwith pride. \\nI now want to move on to a person of the 535 of us that serve \\nin the United States Senate and Congress.

Before joining the State \\nDepartment you worked in multiple leadership positions in the pri-\\nvate sector and you bring that rare combination of private and pub-\\nlic center experience at the highest of levels. \\nNow that I have listed your resume let me say this. Once con-\\nfirmed you will bring leadership experience character and a dedi-\\ncation and passion to this nation\\u2019s security and economic success. \\nIt is so valuable that you are before us right now and Mali espe-\\ncially was once seen as a democratic leader.

That \\neventful day woke the need for service in me. I did not choose the \\nForeign Service. It chose me. It has taken me to India Kuwait Sri \\nLanka Iraq Saudi Arabia twice and if confirmed hopefully to \\nMali. \\nA few months ago Secretary Blinken appropriately observed that \\nMali remains a linchpin for future stability in the Sahel. We have \\ndeep concerns about that stability and deep concerns about the ex-\\ntremism and terrorism that is spreading tentacles in the region. \\nThis is ultimately about the people of Mali and their aspirations \\nfor peace their aspirations for development and respect for human \\nrights. Security partnerships in Mali have shifted in the last year \\nwith the departure of European counterterrorism forces and the ar-\\nrival of the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group. The human rights vio-\\nlations and abuses allegedly committed are not only horrific but \\nwill push aggrieved civilians into the ranks of terrorist groups. \\nIf confirmed I will work to counter Russian disinformation at-\\ntempts to veil the true harm and cost of Wagner\\u2019s actions. \\nAdditionally the United Nations\\u2019 Multidimensional Integrated \\nStabilization Mission in Mali\\u2014MINUSMA\\u2014is facing unprece-\\ndented challenges due to restrictions placed on it. \\nI will advocate for the free movement of MINUSMA peacekeepers \\nand for conditions that allow resumption of accountable inter-\\nnational security assistance to counter the spread of terrorism \\nacross the country. \\nIf confirmed I look forward to leading Embassy Bamako in ad-\\nvancing U.S. interests in Mali. Our main interests include bringing \\nthe country back to a constitutional democracy that helps all of its \\ncitizens furthering economic development and countering the in-\\ncursion of terrorism that threatens not only Mali but the rest of the \\nSahel. \\nWe welcome the agreement to a 24-month timeline between the \\nEconomic Community of West African States\\u2014ECOWAS\\u2014and the \\ntransition government.

He is a respected expert on Asia with a network of relation-\\nships across the continent. \\nI never forgot when I first started visiting Asia when I was on \\nthe committee in 2006 and started going with Michael to visit Asia \\nand it would be very interesting to me when heads of state includ-\\ning when I was chairman of the committee previously would say \\nhello Mr. Schiffer before they would say hello to me. So it just \\ngoes to the depth of relationships he has. \\nI have long relied on Michael\\u2019s counsel expertise and judgment \\nand dealing with some of the most vexing issues facing the com-\\nmittee and no one is more qualified or more deserving of this nom-\\nination than he is. \\nHe is dedicated and committed to a values-based foreign policy \\nthat champions freedom human rights and democracy and he will \\nbe a strong advocate for those principles across the continent and \\nwill work to ensure that AID\\u2019s programming reflect our values and \\nour interests. \\nAnd he is someone who does not hesitate to speak his mind. Sto-\\nries about his willingness to speak truth to power abound. But do \\nnot worry Michael I will not share them here today. \\nBut it is an important quality that will serve him well in the ex-\\necutive branch as he ensures that USAID has a seat at the table \\nand a voice in the interagency process. It is precisely that kind of \\nleadership that we need in the Administration today someone that \\nknows the right approach on assistance to Asia and how to get it \\nthere. \\nSo I appreciate all of those great assets and I will not continue \\nwith my remarks on you because then my time will be eaten up \\nfor questions. So I will include them for the record. \\nMichael thank you for your excellent work with us. \\nMr. Fick to be the Ambassador at Large for Cyberspace and Dig-\\nital Diplomacy is the new frontier for us. The State Department \\nunveiled the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Diplomacy in April \\nthis year. \\nLast week the committee introduced the State Department au-\\nthorization of 2022 which contains a version of the Cyber Diplo-\\nmacy Act that would authorize the CDP bureau in statute and thus \\nsupport its long-term viability. \\nWhat would be your top priorities as Ambassador at Large for \\nthe bureau as it finds its footing in the department? \\nMr. FICK. Thank you Senator for the question and also for hav-\\ning me here today. \\nI have three immediate top priorities and I think of them as con-\\ncentric rings moving from innermost to outermost. Because the bu-\\nreau is new the first and innermost priority is building the team \\nand establishing a culture both in the bureau and in the Depart-\\nment where a fluency and expertise in digital technologies is seen \\nas important to the careers and futures of career Foreign Service \\nOfficers and members of the civil service. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00024\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n25 \\nI can imagine a future where any candidate to be a chief of mis-\\nsion is expected to have an understanding of these issues because \\nthey are a substrate that cut across every aspect of our foreign pol-\\nicy. \\nThe second prioritythis second ring moving outward is to assert \\nthe State Department\\u2019s rightful place in the interagency process on \\ntopics of cybersecurity and digital policy. \\nAnd then third are all the policy challenges out there in the \\nworld. The wolf closest to the door so to speak in my view is the \\nRussian invasion of Ukraine and the threats and opportunities it \\nprovides in the digital space for us; and then I believe our strategic \\ncompetition with China along digital lines is probably the defining \\nstrategic question of my generation. \\nThe CHAIRMAN. I am glad to hear you say about making sure \\nthat the equities of the State Department at the table in the inter-\\nagency process are owned because from my perspective sometimes \\nthe State Department does not get its due as it relates to its crit-\\nical role in the context of the interagency process. So that will be \\nan important one. \\nAnd I hope that you will upon confirmation create a productive \\nrelationship with this committee. This committee has members \\nthat are very interested in this domain and want to engage with \\nyou in the days ahead. \\nMr. FICK. I commit to that sir. \\nThe CHAIRMAN. And if I may Mr. Chairman one other question. \\nMs. Korhonen\\u2014did I pronounce it correctly? Okay. \\nThe Trans-Sahel Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of \\n2021 which is law which I sponsored not only calls for a strategy \\nfor the Sahel it calls for a specific strategy for Mali as part of the \\noverall approach. \\nWe had a hearing where representatives from State DOD and \\nUSAID shared the Administration\\u2019s approach and as I mentioned \\nat that time we look to have input into the strategy as a result of \\nthat hearing. \\nCould you briefly outline for me the draft five-year strategy for \\nMali? How does that strategy differ from the approach of previous \\nAdministrations with respect to balancing the so-called three Ds in \\nMali? \\nMs. KORHONEN. Thank you. I have not seen a five-year strategy \\nfor Mali. \\nI however do know that the department and our interagency \\npartners are working together on multiple issues in Mali and I \\nwould say that if confirmed my priorities will be that we help and \\nsupport the transition government to come to democratic govern-\\nance to elections that they promised with ECOWAS in March \\n2024. Really happy to see that deadline. \\nI also know that this\\u2014just this past Sunday the Algerian Presi-\\ndent Tebboune called for the Malian transition government to hold \\nelections and in fact on Monday there was a meeting\\u2014a decisional \\nmeeting for the Algiers Accord. \\nSo I would say elections transition to democratic governance \\nworking \\nthrough \\nthe \\nAlgerian \\nPeace \\nAccords \\nsupport \\nof \\nMINUSMA is\\u2014are the things that I would really be looking at in \\nterms of what should be happening in Mali in the next five years. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00025\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n26 \\nI believe that is kind of where the department is going at this \\npoint. \\nThe CHAIRMAN. We look forward to working with you because the \\nlaw that we authored ultimately seeks to create a clear vision of \\nwhere we go and a strategy to achieve it versus working ad hoc. \\nMr. Chairman thank you for the courtesy. I have questions for \\nall of the nominees. I am going to submit them for the record in \\ndeference to my colleagues. \\nI would ask you to give me substantive answers. If you do then \\nyou will advance to a business meeting.

Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. \\nMr. Ranking Member? \\nSenator ROUNDS. Thank you Mr. Chairman. \\nOnce again it is good to see the qualifications of the members \\nin front of us here at this time. \\nMr. Fick the deployment of secure fifth-generation or 5G net-\\nworks is critical not only for U.S. networks but throughout the \\nworld with our allies and partners. Meanwhile countries like \\nChina pose a serious threat to our foreign allies and partners \\nthrough companies such as Huawei. \\nThe fiscal year \\u201921 NDAA established a multilateral tele-\\ncommunications security fund executed by the Secretary of State to \\nsupport the development and adoption of secure and trusted tele-\\ncommunications technologies with our partners and allies. Appro-\\npriations for this fund were passed as part of the CHIPS legislation \\nlast week. \\nIf confirmed how do you plan to use this fund to work with our \\npartners and allies to develop secure and trusted alternatives to \\nHuawei and how will you leverage this fund to encourage develop-\\nment of innovative new technologies like Open Radio Access Net-\\nworks known as ORAN? \\nMr. FICK. Thank you Senator. \\nI strongly share the sentiment expressed in your question and \\nbelieve very strongly that global telecom security is essential. I be-\\nlieve that the U.S. cannot do it alone. By its very nature this is a \\nglobal network of hardware and infrastructure and if confirmed I \\nwould work to deploy the resources appropriated in the CHIPS Act. \\nI think from my seat still on the outside looking in I applaud the \\npassage of the Act. Two particular examples for consideration \\nmight be partnering with the European Commission under the \\nTrade and Technology Council in order to finance the deployment \\nof secure infrastructure to third countries. That is something that \\nI would very quickly want to explore. \\nAnother example would be expanding work with the Quad coun-\\ntries in order to promote Open RAN deployments in the Indo-Pa-\\ncific and you have my commitment that I would engage with the \\ncommittee and with Congress before and during any implementa-\\ntion. \\nSenator ROUNDS.

Thank you. \\nAmbassador Tamlyn what is your view on the prospects for cred-\\nible elections in DRC next year? \\nMs. TAMLYN. Thank you sir. \\nThe Congolese have the right to free fair and on time elections \\nand they want that and we know that the path to a more pros-\\nperous and stable DRC lies through a good election and a consoli-\\ndation of their democratic experience. \\nIt is a country with immense challenges because of its size and \\nthe logistics that are needed. The institutions we know are weak. \\nIf confirmed one of my highest priorities would be to immediately \\nreview the planning that is underway to prepare ourselves and the \\ncountry for elections and there are three things in particular that \\nwe need to look at. \\nThe first is progress on national preparations\\u2014how are they \\ndoing in terms of voter rolls procurement and the census that may \\nneed to take place. \\nThe second thing is how is our assistance helping in the right \\nplaces and then finally what is the enabling environment. You \\ncannot have a credible election if there is not an even playing field \\nfor all of the candidates and if rights of freedom of assembly or \\nfreedom of expression are not fully supported. \\nFinally a credible election does not just happen overnight. It is \\nsomething that you need to be preparing for and planning for for \\na good period of time in advance and that includes messaging to \\nthe Government clearly what our expectations are. \\nSo I hope to be able to do that and also work closely with inter-\\nnational partners so their messaging is strong and consistent \\nacross the board. \\nSenator ROUNDS.

I recognize Senator Kaine. \\nSenator KAINE. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Senator \\nRounds. \\nI could ask questions for about an hour of this panel because I \\nthink I could learn a tremendous amount. But let me make two \\ncomments and then really one question that will be for you Am-\\nbassador Tamlyn. \\nFirst to Nathaniel Fick when my son Nathaniel was a senior \\nin high school in December of 2007 and came to me and said Mom \\nand Dad I want you to know that I have been talking to a Marine \\nrecruiter for the last few months I noticed that he had your book \\n\\u2018\\u2018One Bullet Away\\u2019\\u2019 on his bookshelf and I think\\u2014it was a surprise \\nto us when he told us this\\u2014I think your writing was influential in \\nhis decision. \\nHe had an eight-year career as a infantry officer with two de-\\nployments is now a reservist. But I just wanted to say you have \\ninfluenced a lot of people in a lot of your previous capacities but \\nthat book in particular and maybe just\\u2014maybe even the Nathan-\\niel coincidence was one\\u2014helped create a really talented Marine of-\\nficer in my oldest son. \\nMr. FICK. Thank you sir. \\nSenator KAINE. And then Mr. Schiffer I will just say it is really \\na treat to see you back. You performed such good service during my \\ntime on this committee and you are so well suited for the position. \\nAmbassador Tamlyn I am going to take my questions to you in \\na completely different direction because I feel like the five of you \\nare very qualified for the positions that you are going to be going \\nto and I am going to support you all. \\nBut when we have foreign relations folks who are posted in coun-\\ntries right now that I am concerned about I often ask about your \\ncurrent post rather than the one to which you will be nominated \\nand I am very very worried about Sudan and I think I am going \\nto just talk to you a little bit about that. \\nThe reports just within the last few days from CNN that Suda-\\nnese gold has been plundered by Russians to support the Ukrain-\\nian war has led to street protests in Sudan and I am interested \\nthat the Sudanese Government has reacted to these reports by \\ncracking down on plunderers? No. Cracking down on those who re-\\nvealed the information that demonstrated that Russia was plun-\\ndering their gold reserves. \\nWhat do you think this very shocking reporting portends for \\nSudan and what advice would you have for the committee about \\nthe way we should approach the U.S.-Sudanese relationship given \\nthe significant number of challenges in Sudan right now? \\nMs. TAMLYN. Thank you Senator. \\nI think that the path ahead to deal with this and other issues \\nis supporting a civilian-led transitional government. \\nWhat we have seen following the revolution is that only a civil-\\nian-led government is capable of tackling these issues of bringing \\ntransparency to bear on the events happening in the country put-\\nting in place more responsible government institutions and think-\\ning about these issues and trying to figure out a better way of \\ndoing them. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00028\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n29 \\nSo that is our major focus right now. We are working very closely \\nwith all of the stakeholders involved to support a civilian-led tran-\\nsitional government and what we have made clear as well is that \\nuntil there is a credible civilian-led transitional government that \\nhas the broad support of the Sudanese people U.S. assistance will \\nnot be available. \\nSenator KAINE. The reporting is just a few days old and again \\nit is really shocking. I would encourage all my colleagues to read \\nit\\u2014I mentioned many have\\u2014and I applaud CNN for doing such \\ngood work on it. \\nDo you think thus far the reaction in Sudan of the public would \\nsuggest that it would increase the public demand for a stable civil-\\nian government that could hopefully avoid just shocking malfea-\\nsance of the kind that has been reported? \\nMs. TAMLYN. There is no debating this issue. I would say about \\n100 percent of the Sudanese population seek a civilian-led govern-\\nment. There is very clear consensus across the board for many rea-\\nsons but including this one because I think there is a great concern \\nabout the natural resources of the country not being used for the \\nbenefit of the people. \\nI think it simply underscores the importance of moving swiftly \\nforward on this transition. \\nThank you. \\nSenator KAINE. Thank you. With that I yield back Mr. Chair-\\nman. \\nSenator BOOKER. I am grateful for that yielding of about a \\nminute of your time. I am sure Senator Portman respects that tre-\\nmendously. \\nSenator PORTMAN. Yes. \\nSenator BOOKER. Sir we yield to you now for your questions. \\nSenator PORTMAN. It is a good model to emulate. \\nSenator BOOKER. Yes. \\nSenator PORTMAN. First of all I want to thank Chairman Booker \\nand Ranking Member Rounds for holding this hearing and I know \\nthat these nominees have all served their country already but I \\nwant to thank you for stepping up to serve again. \\nAnd with regard to Africa enormous potential often overlooked \\nand so for our nominees heading to African countries we need your \\nU.S. presence there. \\nI am heading to Africa to east Africa mostly with Senator Coons \\nin a couple of weeks and we look forward to that visit. But there \\nare so many questions I could ask about that. \\nBut I am going to focus on something else which is Mr. Fick \\nand again appreciate your service including in the Marine Corps. \\nWhat I am concerned about is that we have overlapping respon-\\nsibilities and authorities with regard to our cyber defense and this \\nhas been something I have worked on for a while with very little \\nresult actually. \\nWe seem to keep adding more and more top cybersecurity posi-\\ntions to our Government and the org chart troubles me. More im-\\nportantly what troubles me is that without accountability I am \\nworried that things will happen and it is too easy to point fingers. \\nAs we saw after the Colonial Pipeline incident you probably recall \\neveryone was pointing fingers. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00029\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n30 \\nSo we have this top position of the deputy national security ad-\\nviser for cyber already which is obviously international in orienta-\\ntion. We have the federal CISO of course at OMB. We have the \\nNational Cyber Directorate which was established by this Con-\\ngress after a commission report that indicated we needed a na-\\ntional director. \\nWe have the CISA director at Department of Homeland Security. \\nOne could argue that we also have at every agency and department \\nothers but in effect they are reporting up at least to somebody. \\nBut your position that you are being nominated for is a new one \\nand I think it overlaps with the Office of the National Cyber Direc-\\ntor. The legislation says that that director \\u2018\\u2018shall serve as the prin-\\ncipal advisor to the President relating to coordination of diplomatic \\nand other efforts to develop norms and international consensus \\naround responsible state behavior in cyberspace\\u2019\\u2019 end quote. \\nSo I just want to know from you one are you sensitive to this \\nissue and aware of it. And again as someone with a military back-\\nground I imagine you share some of my concerns and I would like \\nto hear those if you do and how you intend to conduct yourself in \\nthis role so that you can fit into this construct. \\nCongress is not very good at org charts so it really will be the \\nresponsibility of the individuals who have these jobs to work to-\\ngether and to not allow the gaps in accountability in particular \\nwith regard to the National Cyber Director\\u2019s role which seems to \\noverlap directly with the State Department Cyber and Digital Pol-\\nicy Bureau functions responsibilities. \\nHow would you work collaboratively across all departments to as-\\nsure that we are not being duplicative and ensure that we have ac-\\ncountability? \\nMr. FICK. Thank you Senator. I appreciate the question and the \\nsentiment behind it. \\nI think in addition to my military experience my experience \\nbuilding and leading a business instilled in me an appreciation for \\na clear chain of command and appreciation for clear and well de-\\nfined swim lanes an appreciation for accountability and kind of a \\nwry sense that it is always easy to add but it is hard to subtract \\nand so I come to this role with a heightened sense of concern about \\nthe issue that you raise. \\nAnd that said I have had\\u2014I have a strong conviction that this \\nrole actually fills a gap that has existed in our Government. \\nWhen I was leading a business and working with the Govern-\\nment in this space CISA has a strong presence here. The White \\nHouse has a strong presence here. The Defense Department has a \\nstrong presence here and the State Department has not and I be-\\nlieve that diplomacy should be our tool of first resort. I believe in \\nthe intrinsic value of diplomacy. \\nAnd so I think this role actually does fill an important gap in the \\ncyber and tech responsibilities across the Government. I have \\nknown Director Inglis and Anne Neuberger and Jen Easterly in dif-\\nferent capacities for more than a decade. \\nI have full confidence that we can carve out the right swim lanes \\nand I hope that as the\\u2014if confirmed as the inaugural ambassador \\nleading this office we could create clear lines of responsibility that \\noutlive any individual. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00030\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n31 \\nSenator PORTMAN. Thank you. I appreciate the fact you recognize \\nthe overlap and the potential conflicts and most importantly again \\njust the notion that accountability is necessary for us to be sure we \\nare covering our bases with regard to this growing threat that we \\nface as a country. \\nThank you Mr. Chairman. \\nSenator BOOKER. We are going to go now to Senator Cardin. \\nSenator CARDIN. Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I appre-\\nciate it. I also appreciate the manner in which you conduct this \\nhearing. \\nSenator BOOKER. I am very grateful for that sir. \\nSenator CARDIN. I am glad that you are grateful. \\n[Laughter.] \\nSenator CARDIN. Let me also acknowledge what Senator Rounds \\nindicated during his opening comments that all five of our nomi-\\nnees have a career of public service and you have dedicated your-\\nselves to helping our country. \\nWe know that is a family sacrifice and we thank you and your \\nfamilies for your incredible service to our nation and we are very \\npleased that you are willing to take on these incredibly important \\nresponsibilities in one case a new position in other cases some \\ncritically important countries and the position at USAID. \\nMr. Schiffer as I said earlier as you were being eulogized by our \\nchairman because you are leaving us\\u2014that is the reason\\u2014your \\nservice here was incredible. I thank you very much. I enjoyed all \\nof our opportunities together and you have some real challenges at \\nUSAID and I want to talk a little bit about Burma if I might. \\nIt is a tragic situation. The current government there and its\\u2014 \\nthe human rights records are horrible. So how do we help the peo-\\nple who have been victimized by what has happened in Burma? \\nHow does the United States play a constructive role to try to get \\nhelp out to the people that have been dislocated and abused as a \\nresult of Burmese Government? \\nMr. SCHIFFER. Senator Cardin thank you for your kind com-\\nments and let me also thank you for your leadership on Burma \\nover the years. \\nI share as you know your sense in the tragedy that has befallen \\nthat country since the coup in 2021 and the challenges that we \\nhave in Burma right now. \\nI think it is absolutely vital that the United States stands with \\nthe people of Burma and that we do all that we can working with \\nour partners in the region\\u2014our ASEAN partners\\u2014to assure that \\nthere is humanitarian access so that we can provide assistance to \\nthose who are in the country as well as to provide assistance \\nwhether it is shelter nutritional assistance food assistance edu-\\ncational opportunities to those that have been displaced to camps \\neither in Thailand or in Bangladesh. I think there is a deep moral \\nobligation. \\nAnd then secondly I think we have a continued obligation to \\nwork with civil society actors who remain in Burma who are trying \\nvaliantly to create additional space so that democracy and genuine \\nethnic and national reconciliation might once again get traction in \\nthat country and to work with them to try to lead Burma back to \\na path of democracy and responsible governance. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00031\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n32 \\nI have no illusions about how tough it is. I have no illusions \\nabout the challenges that we face with the military junta in \\nNaypyidaw. \\nBut this is important work and if confirmed it is one of the \\nissues I intend to throw myself into. \\nSenator CARDIN. Thank you. \\nMs. Tamlyn I want to talk a little bit about DRC. There has \\nbeen obviously a challenge in the past. The Government appears \\nto want to make a commitment to fight corruption and I would be \\ninterested as to how we can assist in that regard. \\nThey also have an election coming up in 2023 that we would like \\nto see how we could be\\u2014assist to make sure that is a free and fair \\nelection. \\nSo just tell me your strategies and commitment to the human \\nrights agenda and the democracy agenda to assist in regards to \\nwhat is necessary to fight corruption and to ensure that we have \\nfree and fair elections the best that we can in that country. \\nMs. TAMLYN. Thank you Senator. \\nThose would certainly be among my highest priorities if con-\\nfirmed because we know that human rights abuses and corruption \\nactually eat away at any prospects for the DRC to emerge as a \\nprosperous and stable country. So it is in their interests and it also \\nhas to be the sine qua non of our partnership with them that they \\nare making progress on that. \\nThrough what we call the Privileged Partnership for Peace Pros-\\nperity and Preservation of the Environment which is kind of a \\nportmanteau for a lot of activities that are undergoing we have a \\nstrong human rights and democracy component and we also of \\ncourse are working to support the elections. \\nI just mentioned a couple of things that we are doing. But let me \\nnote that after the last elections we did not fail to call out actors \\nwho had been engaged in corrupt practices and undermining the \\nelections and I think that that stands out as quite the warning \\nand we certainly need to make sure that we keep those tools \\nready if we see the same kind of circumstances repeating them-\\nselves as far as corruption or bad actors that threaten the integrity \\nof the elections. \\nAnd similarly on human rights and corruption we need to hold \\nthe leaders accountable for that and I think that is something that \\nif confirmed would be part of my dialogue with leaders of the coun-\\ntry to make sure that they understand how it is not just a question \\nof words but actions in terms of addressing problems of corruption \\nwhether it is in the military or in other parts of the Government. \\nThank you. \\nSenator CARDIN. I agree. You have our support here in the Sen-\\nate to amplify those issues particularly if we believe that attention \\nis needed in order to get the right results. So thank you. \\nMs. TAMLYN.

With apologies to Rod Stewart thank you \\nChairman. \\nMr. Fick last year I introduced legislation with Senator Warner \\nand the Chairman of this committee that would establish an inter-\\nagency tech partnership office housed at the State Department. \\nThis office would spearhead the United States\\u2019 global efforts to \\nforge robust technology partnerships with like-minded partners \\nand allies with a special focus on norms and standards joint re-\\nsearch and export controls and investment screens. \\nI believe that if America is to truly compete and exceed the Chi-\\nnese Communist Party\\u2019s whole-of-government approach to tech \\ndomination we must harness all the tools of allies and partners and \\nwork together. \\nConsistent with the bipartisan vision of the CHIPS and Science \\nAct which just passed Congress and the President of the United \\nStates will sign into law in a few weeks we are trying to formalize \\nthis effort to crowd in the talent and treasure of other countries in \\nco-developing technologies so that we can have common standards \\nand really marshal all of the collective wherewithal that we have \\nas we think about this generational competition with the CCP. \\nDo you believe that the State Department is best positioned \\nwithin the federal government to lead creation of this interagency \\ntech partnership office? Does the State Department have the re-\\nsources and the ability to harness the necessary expertise within \\nState and beyond to spearhead this effort? \\nMr. FICK. Thank you Senator. \\nI do believe that the State Department as the nation\\u2019s lead for-\\neign policy agency should lead on the partnership aspects of tech-\\nnology collaboration. \\nI appreciate also that this is a cross cutting issue inherently. It \\nhas defense elements it has intelligence elements it has economic \\nelements et cetera. And so I would not expect these efforts to sit \\nexclusively in the State Department. \\nBut I do think as far as partnerships go the StateState Depart-\\nment is properly positioned to lead and I think\\u2014I believe that the \\ncreation of this role helps to elevate and integrate those functions \\nat the State Department and if I am confirmed I would welcome \\nthe opportunity to work with you on this vision. I share a strong \\nsense of its importance and do not believe that we can do it alone. \\nSenator YOUNG. Thank you for that. I would look forward to that \\nopportunity sir. \\nI have also noted with great interest the conclusions of the report \\nof the independent task force that you co-chaired for the Council \\non Foreign Relations \\u2018\\u2018Confronting Reality in Cyberspace.\\u2019\\u2019 The re-\\nport calls for more cohesive links between our national security \\nstrategy and our policy for digital competition. \\nCould you comment on where the U.S. can make meaningful \\nprogress on this aspect of our foreign policy and where you envision \\nyour role to be in making that policy and implementing it if con-\\nfirmed? \\nMr. FICK.

I look behind me here at my children and think \\nthat this is fundamental to shaping the world that they will grow \\nup in. \\nSenator YOUNG. Thank you sir. Got some mic issues here. \\nAnd lastly I will just ask you and if you can answer in fairly \\nshort order going back to the report I referenced in lieu of sanc-\\ntions what tools are available to the United States to strengthen \\nadherence to a framework of responsible state behavior in cyber-\\nspace? \\nMr. FICK. Senator I believe that we have not fully extended de-\\nterrence into the cyber domain. I believe that American power has \\nbeen a force for stability in the world since the end of World War \\nII and our adversaries seek to do mischief or harm us using digital \\nmeans because they know what the consequences are in the phys-\\nical world and we should be marshaling every ounce of our diplo-\\nmatic economic informational and if necessary military power to \\nensure that we extend deterrence into this new domain. \\nSenator YOUNG.

So thank you. \\nI want to start and jump in. \\nMs. Ba you have been spared the scorn in questioning of my col-\\nleagues.

Senator thank you very much for the question. \\nIndeed the impact of the war has made\\u2014exacerbated foods inse-\\ncurity in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and across Africa. Agriculture is one of the \\nmost important sectors for Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. It is one of the largest ex-\\nporters of cocoa\\u2014the largest exporters of cocoa in the world. \\nAnd so we are looking to continue and to deepen these partner-\\nships in the agricultural sector with the U.S. companies that are \\nalready active in the country but also to set and to strengthen a \\nbusiness climate to encourage other American companies because \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00034\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6602\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n35 \\nwhen American companies are working in partnership in Co\\n\\u02c6te \\nd\\u2019Ivoire and across the region we see innovation. \\nAnd so if confirmed I would be focused on strengthening the \\nrole of American companies\\u2014the American model\\u2014to be able to \\nlook at how to not only deal with the immediate crisis of food secu-\\nrity but also to be able to create the conditions so that small-scale \\nfarmers larger farmers women young people can have livelihoods \\nin the agricultural sector and to be able to feed themselves and to \\nbe able to sustain their lives in the long term. \\nSenator BOOKER. I want to ask you just a personal issue. I worry \\nabout our economic relationships often with African nations when \\nwe are often sustaining relationships that reflect the colonization \\nof the past. \\nAnd so when you look at Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire the Government\\u2019s Na-\\ntional Development Plan emphasizes efforts to diversify beyond \\nraw commodity exports which I think is really important for the \\ndevelopment of countries and their strength. \\nThey look to promote domestic processing of cocoa beans or raw \\ncashews into more finished products which I think is a very \\nhealthy economic evolution. \\nHow can the U.S. support this initiative in diversifying their ag-\\nricultural sector while also ensuring that the other priorities\\u2014 \\nhuman rights and more\\u2014continue to be sustained for the evolution \\nof their economy? \\nMs. BA. Thank you for that as well Senator. \\nEconomic opportunity is really the foundation of security very \\noften. They go hand in hand and good governance transparency \\naccountability is also part and parcel. \\nSo if confirmed I would be looking at how to have integrated ap-\\nproaches in all that we do and really to bring the best of the \\nUnited States to bear in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to be able to engage with \\nyoung people because very often young people\\u201477 percent of the \\npopulation of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire are below the age of 35\\u2014they need to \\nbe able to see opportunity and they need to be able to see what is \\npossible. \\nAnd the American model is different than a colonial model and \\ntraditional models and we have incredible companies. We can help \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire diversify their economy looking into other industries \\nas well like cultural industries. \\nBut when we look at American companies encouraging different \\nmodels that can look at corporate social responsibility and to be \\nable to broaden from an integrated perspective economics good \\ngovernance as well as security. \\nSenator BOOKER. Thank you very much. \\nI would like to go quickly to Mr. Fick.

Senator thank you for taking us from thinking about \\nthis issue solely in terms of strategic competition and affording an \\nopportunity to talk about the positive affirmative vision for what \\ntechnology can do globally and I think the Declaration for the Fu-\\nture of the Internet is exactly that. \\nIt is an aspirational framework and it is one that has a lot of \\npower as a galvanizing set of principles to help build a voluntary \\ncoalition of like-minded partners and allies who share our view of \\nan open free interoperable secure digital future. \\nIf confirmed I would use this role to try to expand the number \\nof states who are signatories to that document and do it by telling \\na positive\\u2014again affirmative story of the power of technology. \\nAnd I think about my colleagues down the table who may be rep-\\nresenting the United States in parts of the world where for the \\nfirst time in human history literally at their fingertips young peo-\\nple can have all of the world\\u2019s information available to them and \\nthat is\\u2014that is an incredibly powerful transformative force. \\nSenator BOOKER.

Then \\nI have some of the most grueling brutal questions I have ever \\nasked somebody for Mr. Schiffer and then we are done. I think ev-\\nerybody else is going to submit for the record. \\nMr. Schiffer please get ready for me to come at you hard. \\nBut Mr. Van Hollen go ahead. \\nSenator Van Hollen: Thank you Mr. Chairman and congratula-\\ntions to all of you and I look forward to supporting all of your nomi-\\nnations. You have already been committed to public service in var-\\nious forms and I think you will all do a terrific job in the posts for \\nwhich you have been nominated. \\nMr. Schiffer we are going to miss you here but look forward to \\nworking with you. \\nMr. Fick I was really glad to see Secretary Blinken announce \\nthe establishment\\u2014the formal establishment of the Bureau of \\nCyberspace and Digital Policy. I understand the concerns raised by \\nSenator Portman but I think you addressed them well and I do be-\\nlieve that you will establish those lanes of responsibility. \\nAnd I was glad to hear the Chairman talk about the upside of \\nthe Internet. I mean there are places all over the world where it \\nhas become a forum that brings people together to support freedom \\nof expression human rights. \\nOf course authoritarian regimes recognize that which is why \\nthey are so determined to block off access to that kind of informa-\\ntion.

Thank you Senator. It is mutual. \\nSenator Van Hollen: Thank you. \\nLet me turn if I could to you Ambassador Tamlyn and I heard \\nyour opening statement from my office and appreciate your an-\\nswers to questions here. \\nSo the DRC as you well know is an incredibly complicated place \\nwith all sorts of rivalries and conflicts especially in the east and \\nmy question for you is what do you think is at the heart of those \\nconflicts and what can you do as a U.S. Ambassador to try to ad-\\ndress them in the long-term interests of stability in the DRC? \\nMs. TAMLYN. Thank you Senator. That is a really important \\nquestion because I think too often we get derailed by saying he did \\nsomething they did something somebody did something who is to \\nblame and you really have to look at the root causes of the conflict. \\nAnd in my view it has to do with lack of governance and it has \\nto do with a very valuable part of the country in terms of its nat-\\nural resources. So there is inevitably competition both inside the \\ncountry as well as outside the country for access to those resources. \\nAnd in the absence of a strong government providing services to \\nthe people you have instead a whole network of armed groups \\nwhich provide some form of local governance but usually not a very \\ngood form of local governance. \\nSo what can we do to tackle this situation? We need to work very \\nclosely with regional organizations and with leaders in the region \\nto make sure that tension is deescalated that the region does not \\nfall into another conflict because we have seen how devastating \\nthat was. \\nSo it is very important that leaders get the message and believe \\nme the State Department has been messaging recently to leaders \\non the importance of reducing tensions of cooperating and having \\ndialogue with neighbors and using those regional bodies and mech-\\nanisms to try to resolve conflicts. \\nI think also some of our programming which tries to address \\nroot causes of conflict which can be traced to exploitation of min-\\nerals in a nonsustainable and a nonaccountable nontransparent \\nway if we can address that that helps some of those local griev-\\nances and again supporting the Government to be the kind of gov-\\nernment that provides the security and services to the people that \\nthey aspire to. \\nSenator Van Hollen: Thank you for hitting on all those points \\nand I know that Senator Booker raised the issue of rare earth min-\\nerals in his opening statement. That obviously is part of what is \\nat the heart of this\\u2014a lot of these conflicts and so look forward \\nto working with you on that as well. \\nI do want to bring to your attention a great Marylander who has \\nbeen very involved in the DRC.

I am very grateful for you Senator Cardin. \\nSo I am going to get my Schiffer questions done. Prepare your-\\nself sir. There will be five questions. I hope you can answer them \\nas quickly as possible. Then we will have procedural questions and \\nthen I think we are a wrap. \\nSo Mr. Schiffer obviously there is a crisis in Sri Lanka right \\nnow. The president fled and resigned amongst a really full-scale \\neconomic crisis and protests. There was a new Sri Lankan presi-\\ndent that was elected by the parliament very closely affiliated un-\\nfortunately or fortunately depending on your views here but I \\nimagine it is unfortunately that does not have public confidence. \\nI am really wondering about USAID and what we could do to \\nsort of guide or alter our policies there and how we might respond \\nquickly to support any meaningful democratic process institution \\ncapacity building civil society bolstering in the weeks and months \\nahead. \\nMr. SCHIFFER. Thank you Mr. Chairman. \\nI mean the situation in Sri Lanka has been truly in a different \\nway but similar to Burma tragic over the past several months. \\nMy understanding is that USAID has sought to engage to pro-\\nvide for the immediate humanitarian assistance given the eco-\\nnomic crisis on the ground and in Sri Lanka and that we\\u2014the \\nUSAID is part of the larger set of activities to coordinate with \\nother partners in the region including through the Quad to look \\nto support proper governance in Sri Lanka. \\nI think this is a long-term rebuilding process. It is an issue that \\nif confirmed I do intend to look at closely and come back to this \\ncommittee and to you to consult and to get your guidance. \\nSenator BOOKER. I really hope we can have that conversation. \\nAll right sir. This is the speed round four last questions the \\nlast chance this committee is going to have to verbally question you \\nbefore you leave us. We all have abandonment issues as senators \\nso prepare yourself. \\nYour first question\\u2014you are an Asia expert correct? \\nMr. SCHIFFER. Allegedly. \\nSenator BOOKER.

Could you please tell me your three favorite \\nmale K-pop bands? \\nMr. SCHIFFER. There is only one K-pop band and that is BTS. So \\nthat is my answer. \\nSenator BOOKER. That is wrong and let the record show that you \\ngot yet another answer wrong. \\nAnd then finally you know that modern mathematics was really \\ninnovated in Asia\\u2014the extraordinary accomplishments in math \\nand science. \\nSo my final question for you sir\\u2014three wrong answers for an \\nAsia expert\\u2014but my final question for you sir is what is the \\nsquare root of 1256? \\nMr. SCHIFFER. Am I allowed to call on a family member? \\nSenator BOOKER. You cannot phone a friend sir. \\n[Laughter.] \\nSenator BOOKER.

I would hope that there would \\nbe a hearty yes from all of you in unison. You do not have to har-\\nmonize your yeses but I would like to hear them if possible. \\nDo you agree to appear before this committee and make officials \\nfrom your office available to the committee and designated staff \\nwhen invited? \\n[All witnesses answer in the affirmative.] \\nSenator BOOKER.

Two years ago President Ouattara made the decision to run for a third \\nterm in office triggering the most serious unrest in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire since the conflict \\nin 2011. His main political rivals like him are from an older generation of political \\nelites. How would you assess the state of democracy in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and what will \\nyou do as ambassador if confirmed to empower democratic voices-especially from \\nthe youth and marginalized communities-and improve governance in the country? \\nAnswer. Ivoirians overwhelmingly prefer democracy to any other form of govern-\\nment\\u2014a conclusion based on independent polling by Afrobarometer. If confirmed I \\nwill stress the common democratic values shared by the Americans and Ivoirians\\u2014 \\nparticipation inclusion transparency and accountability\\u2014assured through the \\ndemocratic process. Although the 2020 presidential election period was marked by \\nseveral incidents of violence the national legislative elections in March 2021 were \\nconducted freely and fairly with broad participation from opposition parties. The \\nnext election cycle is expected to begin in 2023 for municipal and regional seats fol-\\nlowed by presidential and legislative elections in 2025 and 2026 respectively. If con-\\nfirmed I will prioritize U.S. support throughout the election process expanding out-\\nreach and coordination with partners in country and with multilateral institutions \\nlike the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African \\nUnion. I will urge all actors to participate peacefully and to hold those responsible \\nfor any violence accountable. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s future depends on free and fair elections \\nthat are held peacefully with an inclusive and transparent electoral process. If con-\\nfirmed I will urge the Government and political parties to engage in a real process \\nof reconciliation through continuation of their own National Political Dialogue. To \\nchampion participation especially by women young people and marginalized com-\\nmunities I will encourage Ivoirians to get their national ID cards and register to \\nvote. Our Embassy will continue to support the culmination of a larger voter lit-\\neracy effort that ensures increased civic awareness and involvement for the average \\ncitizen particularly women youth and other marginalized communities. If con-\\nfirmed I will also urge the Government to make voter registration as easy as pos-\\nsible for all eligible voters to ensure robust participation. I will prioritize opportuni-\\nties to leverage our programs and convening power to support democratic institu-\\ntions and the democratic process. \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire like other countries in coastal West Africa is vulnerable to the \\nspread of violent extremism from the Sahel. In response to this threat the Adminis-\\ntration has targeted five countries in coastal West Africa including Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\npriorities under the Global Fragility Act. While these countries face some similar \\nchallenges there are also marked differences between them including very different \\nsystems of governance. For example Ghana is a relatively strong democracy and \\nGuinea is currently under military rule. The five countries also vary in terms of in-\\ncome level social cohesion and state capacity. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00041\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n42 \\nQuestion. How does the violent extremist threat manifest itself in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nDo you believe that our current assistance programming to counter violent extre-\\nmism in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is appropriately balanced between defense diplomacy and de-\\nvelopment? \\nAnswer. Violent extremist organizations based in the Sahel have announced their \\nintention to target Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and other coastal West African states. In the last \\ntwo years over 20 attacks mainly targeting security services have occurred in the \\nnorthern region of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire along the border with Burkina Faso. If confirmed \\nas U.S. Ambassador to Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire I will work with a broad range of stakeholders \\nwithin the Ivoirian Government and civil society to ensure that implementation of \\nthe U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS) includes the \\nappropriate balance of defense diplomacy and development tools to support Co\\n\\u02c6te \\nd\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s National Development Plan and government-community cooperation to \\nbuild resilience against this threat. If confirmed I will work with the interagency \\nEmbassy team as well as our regional partners at the USAID-West Africa regional \\nmission USAFRICOM and my counterparts in Guinea Ghana Togo and Benin to \\nsupport the Ivoirian people at the community national and regional level. In imple-\\nmenting the SPCPS I will prioritize constant evaluation of our investment of U.S. \\nassistance re-balancing any emphasis of our approach to build on opportunities to \\ncounter violent extremism. \\nQuestion. How will you ensure that resources and programming implemented \\nthrough the Global Fragility Act are appropriately tailored to the requirements of \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work with various stakeholders within the Ivoirian \\nGovernment and civil society to ensure programming through the Global Fragility \\nAct implemented according to the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote \\nStability (SPCPS) is aligned with Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s National Development Plan and \\nfacilitates meaningful government-community cooperation. Specifically the tools we \\nwill use to implement the SPCPS can reinforce local and national early warning sys-\\ntems and action plans to prevent the spread of violent extremism; support existing \\ncommunity-led platforms such as civilian-military committees to foster trust be-\\ntween marginalized communities and security forces; professionalize law enforce-\\nment and other government officials to engender trust with the communities they \\nserve; and strengthen legal capabilities to hold violent extremist actors accountable. \\nIf confirmed I will also emphasize the unique tools each of our interagency partners \\nbrings to the challenges in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to ensure efficient and effective whole-of- \\ngovernment action to achieve the U.S. objective of long-term peace and stability. \\nUnder my leadership through interagency coordination and planning U.S. Embassy \\nAbidjan will tailor USG assistance to the specific needs of local communities to rein-\\nforce their resilience against the threat of violent extremism while creating oppor-\\ntunities to build trust with state authorities. To implement this long-term plan U.S. \\nEmbassy Abidjan plans to hire additional staff to collect and analyze data to ensure \\nthat USG resources and programming are contextually relevant most effectively to \\nthe requirements of communities in various regions of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nDemocracy and Human Rights \\nQuestion. What are the most important actions you have taken in your career to \\ndate to support democracy and human rights? What has been the impact of your \\nactions? \\nAnswer. Throughout my career I have been dedicated to championing democracy \\nand respect for human rights. Most of my overseas tours were in countries in which \\nthe U.S. Government focused on building government and civil society capacity \\nwhere I worked to advance democracy and respect for human rights. I learned that \\nindividual actions can make a difference to shape outcomes that support others in \\ndefending their rights when they may not have the resources or freedom to do alone \\nin constrained democratic space. In Guinea I led our Embassy\\u2019s effort to empower \\ntrade unions through the creative use of the Human Rights and Democracy Fund. \\nU.S. assistance helped bring unions together across sectors in a country where the \\nauthoritarian regime curtailed human rights and weakened civil society. The labor \\ncoalition organized and began peaceful protests against then-President Lansana \\nConte. When the regime responded with violence the labor leaders continued to mo-\\nbilize Guineans to demand change. When security forces stormed the headquarters \\nof one of the unions I mobilized our Embassy colleagues across agencies who \\nweighed in with their counterparts to ensure due process. The labor leaders credited \\nour embassy with saving their lives. We continued to support the unions and I \\nshared best practices from American labor and civil rights movements.

The labor movement led general nationwide strikes that \\neventually pushed the president to appoint a more inclusive cabinet and they won \\na promise for democratic elections for the Guinean people to chart their own future. \\nFrom this experience I recognized that my actions to support democratic coali-\\ntions and build partnerships to advance universal human rights could make a dif-\\nference. U.S. support inspired confidence in Guinea\\u2019s citizens to stand up for their \\nrights and build a movement that opened new opportunities for democratic renewal. \\nI took lessons from Guinea to each of my subsequent assignments. For example in \\nSomalia I negotiated among warring parties in the Djibouti Peace Process for the \\nelection of a new transitional federal government integrating wider representation \\nof moderate voices. In Kenya I engaged women youth groups and the private sec-\\ntor to support a peaceful referendum and electoral process. In Iraq I insisted that \\nthe U.S. police training program include human rights instruction in every aspect \\nof our engagement even when the Iraqi Government requested that we remove \\nthese program components. I worked with the African Union to strengthen its elec-\\ntions monitoring and collaborated with partners and AU member states to invest \\nmore resources to support elections across the African continent. In Chad I engaged \\nat the highest level of the Government to link our assistance to accountability for \\nhuman rights violations. We centered all partnerships for security sector reform on \\nbuilding more transparent institutions for the benefit of the people of Chad. I con-\\nsistently open space for those seeking to make their voices heard and create oppor-\\ntunities to leverage U.S. assistance resources to support human rights and advance \\ndemocracy. If confirmed I will bring this experience to support the aspirations of \\nthe people of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nQuestion. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy or demo-\\ncratic development in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? These challenges might include obstacles to \\nparticipatory and accountable governance and institutions rule of law authentic po-\\nlitical competition civil society human rights and press freedom. Please be as spe-\\ncific as possible. \\nAnswer. One of the biggest challenges to democratic development in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\nis ensuring that the Government can meet the needs of all its citizens particularly \\nvulnerable groups in the North of the country. The United States is deeply con-\\ncerned about increased violent extremism along the northern Ivoirian border. The \\nGovernment of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has expressed its support for the U.S. Strategy to Pre-\\nvent Conflict and Promote Stability (SPCPS) the implementation of which will sup-\\nport the Government\\u2019s efforts to address many of these needs in the region. One of \\nthe main lines of effort for the U.S. Strategy is to focus on building trust between \\nsecurity forces and the communities they serve. \\nMore broadly Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has never experienced a peaceful transition of power. \\nThe 2021 legislative elections were a significant step towards reconciliation and \\nsocio-political cohesion. The ongoing national political dialogue is making important \\nprogress. However this progress remains fragile and if confirmed I will ensure the \\nUnited States supports the people of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire as the country moves towards the \\n2023 local elections and the 2025 presidential election. \\nAs part of the effort to build social cohesion the United States has called on the \\nGovernment of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to respect the human rights of all individuals in Co\\n\\u02c6te \\nd\\u2019Ivoire notably freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly and to ensure that \\nall those arrested are afforded fair trials. Through implementation of the SPCPS \\nEmbassy Abidjan is planning to support a judicial advisor to support Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s \\njustice sector reforms. If confirmed I will continue to speak out for democratic plu-\\nralism rule of law press freedom and respect for human rights. \\nQuestion. What steps will you take\\u2014if confirmed\\u2014to support democracy in of \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? What do you hope to accomplish through these actions? What are the \\npotential impediments to addressing the specific obstacles you have identified? \\nAnswer. Supporting good governance and democracy in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is a key goal \\nof our bilateral relationship. If confirmed I will continue to urge the Government \\nof Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to capitalize on their advancements towards increasing respect for \\ndemocracy and human rights and fundamental freedoms through their National \\nDialogue and Reconciliation plan. I will also work with Ivoirian civil society and op-\\nposition groups to encourage their participation in the democratic process.

If confirmed I would utilize all available U.S. assistance tools and pro-\\ngrams to support democracy and governance in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and prioritize pro-\\ngrams that best support U.S. goals in the country. The continued use of available \\nState Department and USAID regional and centrally managed resources are crucial \\nto advancing democracy and respect for human rights in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire.

I will strive to support the efforts of these figures and parties to develop \\na more inclusive political environment in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire including their participation \\nin the government-initiated dialogue with opposition parties. I will urge the Govern-\\nment to ensure the freedom of association and peaceful assembly for all political ac-\\ntors even those with whom they do not agree. The upcoming 2023 local elections \\nare a key steppingstone for young people women and minorities in particular who \\nwant to enter politics because they offer more opportunities for seats than national- \\nlevel elections.

If confirmed I will engage civil society and government counterparts to \\nbuild on the embassy team\\u2019s progress and programs to combat disinformation and \\npropaganda perpetuated by foreign state and non-state actors. A well-informed pop-\\nulation is required for a functioning democracy and I will prioritize our efforts to \\nbuild a stronger information and media ecosystem to combat misinformation and \\ndisinformation. I will support embassy programs to educate journalists about the \\ndangers of disinformation including training that offers recent examples like the \\ndisinformation circulated on the efficacy and safety of COVID\\u201319 vaccines and on \\nRussia\\u2019s war in Ukraine. USAID and State Public Diplomacy will continue to work \\nwith social media influencers local radio stations and community storytellers to \\ndeconstruct misinformation and disinformation particularly in northern commu-\\nnities to address issues pertaining to violent extremism and attempts to distance \\nthe population from the state. \\nQuestion. Will you and your embassy teams actively engage with Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire on \\nthe right of labor groups to organize including for independent trade unions? \\nAnswer. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s law including related regulations and statutory instru-\\nments provides for the right of workers except members of police and military serv-\\nices to form or join unions of their choice; provides for the right to conduct legal \\nstrikes and bargain collectively; and prohibits discrimination by employers or others \\nagainst union members or organizers. It further prohibits firing workers for union \\nactivities and provides for the reinstatement of dismissed workers within eight days \\nof winning a wrongful dismissal claim. The law protects unions\\u2019 ability to conduct \\ntheir activities without interference. Worker organizations in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire have \\nbeen independent of the Government and political parties. Despite strong legal \\nframeworks forced labor and labor trafficking have been documented in key eco-\\nnomic sectors. Concerns regarding government enforcement of worker rights\\u2019 protec-\\ntions including on child labor and forced labor remain. If confirmed I and my team \\nwill encourage the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to enforce the legal rights of orga-\\nnized labor civil society and workers. By putting the right tools in the hands of \\nlabor inspectors business owners workers and service providers we can advance \\ngreater transparency and accountability prevent bad actors from profiting on the \\nbacks of workers and better identify when grueling or poorly paid work becomes \\ninvoluntary forced labor thus violating international standards and national laws. \\nQuestion. Will you commit to using your position if confirmed to defend the \\nhuman rights and dignity of all people in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire no matter their sexual ori-\\nentation or gender identity? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to support the human rights of all residents \\nof Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and their ability to live free from discrimination based on their iden-\\ntity ethnicity or medical status. Through collaboration with Ivoirian NGOs the \\nEmbassy supports programming that promotes the human rights and representation \\nof women and LGBTQI+ persons in politics increases their access to the Ivoirian \\neconomy and increases public-private partnerships to encourage citizen participa-\\ntion and local governance. Embassy Abidjan\\u2019s PEPFAR program directly improves \\naccess to and quality of HIV services for members of the LGBTQI+ population \\nthrough engagement with the Ministry of Health LGBTQI+-led organizations and \\nexternal stakeholders including UNAIDS. Under my leadership we will not com-\\npromise on these important American and global ideals. If confirmed I will work \\nhard to encourage Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to continue this positive trajectory. \\nQuestion. What challenges do the lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer \\n(LGBTQ) people face in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. Violence and discrimination targeting LGBTQI+ persons remain a chal-\\nlenge in the country primarily due to societal norms. Homosexuality is not illegal \\nbut it is not widely accepted. Same-sex marriages are not recognized as legal unions \\nin Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and legal protections against discrimination do not exist. A 2022 \\neffort in parliament to provide legal protections against discrimination was with-\\ndrawn in the face of public opposition.

If confirmed I will call on the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to investigate \\nallegations of violence and discrimination targeting LGBTQI+ persons. I also com-\\nmit to continuing the Embassy\\u2019s strong slate of programming around LGBTQI+ \\nissues in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. I will pledge to work with the LGBTQI+ community and fol-\\nlow their lead under the principle of \\u2033do no harm\\u2033 to promote respect for the \\nhuman rights of LGBTQI+ persons. PEPFAR\\u2019s ongoing engagement with Ivoirian \\ncivil society to improve HIV/TB services and respect for the human rights of every \\nmember of the LGBTQI+ community presents an additional opportunity for my di-\\nrect engagement and advocacy. \\nCongressional Consultations \\nQuestion. Will you commit if confirmed to ensuring that you fully brief members \\nof congress and/or their staff each time you are in Washington for visits or consulta-\\ntions during your tenure as Ambassador to Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit in coordination with the State Department\\u2019s Bu-\\nreau of Legislative Affairs to respond promptly to all appropriate requests for brief-\\nings and for information by this Committee. Congress has an important role to play \\nin foreign policy legislation and during the implementation process. Our foreign pol-\\nicy is stronger when the two branches of government coordinate and I look forward \\nto strengthening the coordination between our two branches. \\nDiversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility \\nQuestion. Last week we held a hearing on the important work of the State De-\\npartment\\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer and the important role diversity equity inclu-\\nsion and accessibility efforts play in maintaining our countries\\u2019 competitive edge on \\nthe global stage. How do you anticipate fostering diversity equity inclusion and \\naccessibility at Embassy Abidjan? \\nAnswer. Throughout my State Department career I have championed a diverse \\ninclusive and equitable work environment and have encouraged policies that ad-\\nvance these values. If confirmed I intend to bring that same spirit to Embassy \\nAbidjan by supporting post\\u2019s inclusive hiring and selection procedures and to expand \\nrecruiting to ensure we have the greatest expertise and diversity of experience rep-\\nresented in our mission. I will ensure active community participation in Embassy \\nAbidjan\\u2019s Diversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility Council and support initia-\\ntives the Council proposes. I will also encourage every member of the Embassy to \\nmake recommendations on how we can be more inclusive and equitable in our oper-\\nations practices and policies. Embassy Abidjan has already been active in this \\narea with monthly dialogues on these issues and institutional innovations such as \\ncross-cultural training Mission-wide mentorship programs and targeted hiring for \\npersons with disabilities. I commit to listening to both local and U.S. colleagues to \\nensure that we continue to make progress on these gains. \\nQuestion. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote diversity equity \\ninclusion and accessibility while also combating racism discrimination and in-\\nequality among locally employed staff in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will make clear that Embassy Abidjan will have a zero- \\ntolerance policy for racism and discrimination in keeping with Equal Employment \\nOpportunity laws. I intend to ensure that all employees working in Embassy \\nAbidjan whether they are locally employed staff eligible family members or U.S. \\ndirect hires feel supported and have the tools and opportunities they need to con-\\ntribute to our priorities. I will seek input on ways to make our operations programs \\nand outreach more equitable including by maintaining an open office policy and wel-\\ncoming the contributions and ideas of all working in our mission. I will also actively \\nsupport Embassy Abidjan\\u2019s existing mentorship programs for First and Second Tour \\nOfficers Mid-level U.S. Direct Hires and our Locally Engaged Staff.

RISCH \\nQuestion. In December 2020 President Ouattara was sworn in for a controversial \\n3rd term as president of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. The issue of the 3rd term was a significant \\nissue in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and taken against a backdrop of multiple coups in the region \\nsince 2020 is part of a worrying trend. \\n\\u2022 As U.S. Ambassador to Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire how will you engage with Ivorian stake-\\nholders ahead of the 2024 elections to ensure a peaceful democratic transfer of \\npower? \\nAnswer. Ivoirians overwhelmingly prefer democracy than any other form of gov-\\nernment\\u2014a conclusion based on independent polling by Afrobarometer. If confirmed \\nI will stress the common democratic values shared by the Americans and Ivoirians\\u2014 \\nparticipation inclusion transparency and accountability\\u2014assured through the \\ndemocratic process. Although the 2020 presidential election period was marked by \\nseveral incidents of violence the nationwide legislative elections in March 2021 \\nwere conducted freely and fairly with broad participation from opposition parties. \\nThe next election cycle is expected to begin in 2023 for municipal and regional seats \\nfollowed by presidential and legislative elections due in 2025 and 2026 respectively. \\nI will prioritize U.S. support throughout the election process expanding outreach \\nand coordination with partners in country and with multilateral institutions like the \\nEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union. If \\nconfirmed I will urge all actors to participate peacefully and to hold those respon-\\nsible for violence accountable. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s future depends on free and fair elec-\\ntions that are inclusive transparent and peaceful. \\nIf confirmed I will urge the Government and political parties to engage in a real \\nprocess of reconciliation through continuation of their own National Political Dia-\\nlogue. To champion participation especially by women young people and \\nmarginalized communities I will encourage Ivoirians to get their national ID cards \\nand register to vote. I will also urge the Government to make registering as easy \\nas possible for all eligible voters to ensure participation is as high and robust as \\npossible. I will ensure Embassy efforts around political participation and inclusivity \\ncontinue through the election cycles such as the ongoing USAID programming to \\nencourage political reconciliation in communities affected by the election-related vio-\\nlence of 2020 and State and USAID efforts to increase political participation among \\nhistorically underrepresented groups in particular youth and women. I will \\nprioritize opportunities to leverage our programs and convening power to support \\ndemocratic institutions and the democratic process. \\nAs concerns about the spread of violent extremist organizations across the Sahel \\nincreases U.S. strategy for preventing violent extremism has shifted focus to the \\ncountries of coastal West Africa including Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire.

While Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is a source of cocoa for numerous American and European \\nchocolate companies the industry is also working to combat worrying levels of child \\nlabor in the production of cocoa in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and Ghana. \\n\\u2022 As U.S. Ambassador to Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire how will you engage with both the Gov-\\nernment of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and American chocolate companies to address the issue \\nof child labor while also balancing the important role cocoa plays in the Ivorian \\neconomy and to American companies? \\nAnswer. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has made significant efforts to eliminate the worst forms \\nof child labor. The Government has addressed child labor conditions through the \\nadoption elaboration and amendment of several policies laws and programs. \\nThese efforts included finalizing the National Action Plan for the Fight Against the \\nWorst Forms of Child Labor revising the Labor Code adopting an Anti-Trafficking \\nlaw in 2016 signing a cross-border cooperation agreement with Ghana drafting a \\ndocument specifying types of permitted light work and revising the list of haz-\\nardous work. \\nI am aware of heightened concerns about child labor in the cocoa sector and if \\nconfirmed I and my Embassy Team as well as interagency colleagues will work \\nclosely with the Ivoirian Government other countries NGOs and the chocolate in-\\ndustry to address them. I will continue to work with the Ivoirian Government and \\nthe U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) through the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating \\nGroup (CLCCG). U.S. companies expressed concern about the expiration of the Har-\\nkin-Engel Protocol which offered a forum for public and private sector engagement \\non efforts to reduce child labor in the production of cocoa. \\nI am also aware of the important place that the cocoa sector has in the Ivoirian \\neconomy and of the investment that U.S. companies have made in the cocoa sector \\nwhich is improving livelihoods in this region. If confirmed I will continue the Em-\\nbassy\\u2019s close dialogue and coordination with U.S. and international cocoa companies \\nwhich do business in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. Realizing that poverty and limited access to edu-\\ncation are significant drivers of child labor if confirmed I will continue our active \\nsupport of sustainable and resilient economic growth women\\u2019s economic empower-\\nment improving access to education and improving health services. Our efforts to \\nincrease law enforcement capacity will help Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire deal with those who use \\nand traffic in child labor. Together we can incorporate holistic solutions to combat \\nthe worst forms of child labor in the cocoa sector. \\nState Department Manangement and Public Diplomacy \\nQuestion. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over the last few \\nyears in large part due to COVID. What is your understanding of morale through-\\nout Mission Abidjan? \\nAnswer. Embassy Abidjan\\u2019s strong morale has been driven by community-led in-\\nvestments in the mission\\u2019s institutions including mentorship programs for both \\nlocal and U.S. employees its Diversity Equity Inclusion and Accessibility Council \\ngreening initiatives and active employee associations. I intend to continue sup-\\nporting these vital organizations and making the most out of employee and family \\nmember contributions along the way. However maintaining this positive momen-\\ntum in the face of external challenges and rapid growth will require additional re-\\nsources to ensure we can build upon our promising relationship with the host gov-\\nernment. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Abidjan? \\nAnswer. If confirmed maintaining morale of all members of Mission Abidjan will \\nbe of utmost importance for me. I intend to work closely with my staff understand \\ntheir concerns and seek ways to find immediate remedies for issues that we can ad-\\ndress in Abidjan. For those issues where our community requires additional support \\nI will communicate staff needs back to Department leadership.

If confirmed I will prioritize collaboration and \\npartnerships including from Congressional representatives to achieve U.S. policy \\npriorities in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nQuestion. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to berate subordi-\\nnates either in public or private? \\nAnswer. Absolutely not. Under no circumstances is that ever acceptable. And if \\nconfirmed I will not tolerate that behavior by any member of the Embassy Abidjan \\ncommunity. I will clearly emphasize my expectation that all members of our team \\ntreat one another and all people with whom we come into contact with mutual re-\\nspect. \\nQuestion. How do you envision your leadership relationship with your deputy \\nchief of mission? \\nAnswer. The relationship between an Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission \\nis fundamental to the success of an Embassy. From my experience serving as a \\nDCM I recognize the importance of establishing the positive and productive leader-\\nship necessary for the Mission to achieve its goals. If confirmed I will build a rela-\\ntionship of trust with my primary advisor\\u2014the Deputy Chief of Mission.

Do you believe that it is important to provide \\nemployees with accurate constructive feedback on their performances in order to \\nencourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles? \\nAnswer. Yes. I believe that providing accurate and constructive feedback is impor-\\ntant both through formal evaluations and continuously as we carry out our mission. \\nThis kind of dialogue is important both for Locally Engaged Staff and U.S. Direct \\nHire employees and I hope to build that culture in Abidjan. I will ensure that each \\nForeign Service Officer has accurate and timely EERs and that all staff have the \\nappropriate evaluations of their performance. I will require all managers to offer di-\\nrect feedback about the performance of their staff listening actively to what their \\nteam needs to contribute more to priority embassy goals. If confirmed I fully intend \\nto reward those who succeed in their roles in the mission providing an incentive \\nfor all to achieve their work objectives. \\nQuestion. If confirmed would you support and encourage clear accurate and di-\\nrect feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward high achiev-\\ners? \\nAnswer. Yes. I would support and encourage clear accurate and direct feedback \\nto employees to improve performance and reward high achievers. I also want em-\\nployees to feel comfortable taking calculated risks and pursuing innovative ap-\\nproaches to advancing our policy. This requires honest dialogue and a culture of \\ntrust between employees and supervisors. I intend to promote this approach if con-\\nfirmed. \\nQuestion. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts abroad to meet \\nwith local actors including host government officials non-government organizations \\nand fellow foreign diplomats stationed in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. In your opinion do U.S. dip-\\nlomats get outside of our embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions? \\nAnswer. In my experience it is imperative that U.S. diplomats leave their office \\nspace and meet business civil society development media and government leaders \\nin the country in which they work. If confirmed I will compel my staff to work safe-\\nly and responsibly in the economic capital of Abidjan and throughout Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\nto achieve our foreign policy goals. For example to fulfill their roles in technical and \\nfinancial oversight of USG funds it is critical for Embassy staff to regularly engage \\nwith field-level beneficiaries and implementing partners. As such the management \\nlogistical and security support to facilitate this field presence will be among my pri-\\norities. Throughout my career I have valued both personally and professionally the \\nrelationships I have fostered outside the office to achieve Mission goals. Therefore \\nI also intend to travel throughout Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire inviting members of the mission \\nteam across sections to join me to ensure that the United States is visible outside \\nof Abidjan. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. diplomats to better \\naccess all local populations? \\nAnswer. While the COVID\\u201319 pandemic has limited our ability to meet local pop-\\nulations in person face-to-face contact is vital to the successful advancement of U.S. \\npolicy goals in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. If confirmed I will listen to my team to understand \\nwhat personnel financial or technological resources they need from the Department \\nto carry out our mission effectively. I will advocate to obtain these resources to sup-\\nport engagement including creative use of media platforms to amplify and sustain \\naccess and engagement with local populations. \\nQuestion. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign policy efforts. \\nWhat is the public diplomacy environment like in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. The population in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is generally receptive to U.S. messaging \\nand our team continues developing creative ways to reach all populations in the \\ncountry. Challenges include the COVID\\u201319 pandemic poor transportation options \\nand greater insecurity in certain parts of the country. Populations outside of the eco-\\nnomic capital of Abidjan feel isolated and marginalized. As such I understand the \\nPublic Diplomacy team in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is focused on programming in remote areas \\nboth at our American Spaces in the northern parts of the country and by optimizing \\ntravel by all Mission members to different regions of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire.

As in many other parts of the world our Mission team is atten-\\ntive to activity in the public diplomacy arena from global competitors. \\nQuestion. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face there? \\nAnswer. The COVID\\u201319 pandemic has made getting out of the office for Public \\nDiplomacy work very challenging but I understand Mission members have been \\ntraveling more widely in recent months as conditions in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire have im-\\nproved. Poor transportation infrastructure and security concerns in the country \\nmake travel even more of an undertaking but Mission members understand it is \\ncritical to get outside the walls of the Embassy to perform public diplomacy work \\neffectively. I understand the Country Team coordinates very well together to make \\nsure Mission members can move throughout Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to ensure outreach in-\\ncluding to marginalized communities. The media environment in the country con-\\ntinues to develop positively and our team is actively engaged in supporting those \\nefforts to ensure free and equal access to information for all persons in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nIt is critical to link life-saving interventions such as those supported by PEPFAR \\nand the Global Health Security Agenda with Public Diplomacy to ensure appro-\\npriate communication of USG funding impact. I will encourage coordination and \\ncommunication among sections such that the Public Affairs Office is well-positioned \\nto disseminate the myriad examples of fruitful USG collaboration in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nIf confirmed I will encourage and support all members of the Mission to take part \\nin public diplomacy to engage Ivoirians across sectors and regions. \\nQuestion. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus the in-country \\nmission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy messages for foreign audiences? \\nAnswer. I believe it is critical for our public diplomacy team to remain in close \\ntouch with colleagues at the State Department in Washington balancing the re-\\nquirements and guidance from Washington with the priorities \\u2018in the field\\u2019 to tailor \\nmessaging to local realities. Our Public Diplomacy teams must develop and main-\\ntain excellent relationships with colleagues in Washington and across the region in \\norder to ensure that messaging is coordinated and that there are no surprises on \\neither side. I understand our team in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire works hard with Washington and \\nregional colleagues to ensure synchronized and accurate messaging around all of the \\nU.S. Government\\u2019s work. \\nQuestion. \\u2018\\u2018Anomalous health incidents\\u2019\\u2019 commonly referred to as \\u2018\\u2018Havana Syn-\\ndrome\\u2019\\u2019 have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. diplomats around the world for \\nyears. They have caused serious negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy yet \\nmany believe that the Department is not doing enough to care for protect and com-\\nmunicate to its personnel. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed do you commit to taking this threat seriously? \\nAnswer. Yes I commit to addressing this threat. I am deeply troubled by potential \\nanomalous health incidents that have affected U.S. Government personnel and their \\nfamily members. Serving one\\u2019s country overseas should not come at the cost of one\\u2019s \\nhealth. I agree that such incidents may pose a threat to the well-being of U.S. per-\\nsonnel and must be taken extremely seriously. I understand Embassy Abidjan has \\nput in place standard operating procedures and communicated them widely to the \\nmission community so action can be taken swiftly and seamlessly if any AHIs are \\nreported. If confirmed the health safety and security of Embassy staff their family \\nmembers and all those supporting the mission will be my highest priority. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to talking as openly as you can to Mission \\nAbidjan personnel? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I am committed to regularly share new information on this \\nissue consistent with ensuring the integrity of ongoing investigations. I commit to \\nensuring that our staff have the resources they need to remain safe and resilient \\nin the face of these challenges. \\nHuman Rights and International Organizations \\nQuestion. In the State Department\\u2019s 2021 Report on Human Rights Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\nis noted for significant human rights issues including arbitrary killings; harsh or \\nlife-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests; politically motived reprisals; \\nproblems with an independent judiciary restrictions on freedoms of expression; cor-\\nruption; and more. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed how would you work with the host government to address these \\nissues? \\nAnswer.

Furthermore the United States has called on the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te \\nd\\u2019Ivoire to respect the human rights of all individuals in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire notably free-\\ndoms of expression and peaceful assembly and to ensure that all those arrested are \\nafforded fair trials. If confirmed I will continue to speak out for democratic plu-\\nralism rule of law and respect for human rights. \\nQuestion. What steps could you take with prison authorities of the state to im-\\nprove life-threatening prison conditions? \\nAnswer. There are several programs from the Bureau of International Narcotics \\nand Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) that facilitate the development and improve-\\nment of correctional systems. If confirmed I intend to thoroughly review our current \\nprograms and consider others that will support the transformation of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s \\nprison systems. \\nQuestion. The report additionally notes that within prisons human rights groups \\nreport that security officers subject prisoners to abuse such as denial of needed med-\\nicine and medical attention electric shock and beatings. Authorities acknowledge \\nthat abuse might happen and go unreported due to prisoners\\u2019 fear of reprisal and \\nimpunity was a problem with security forces. \\n\\u2022 How could you engage with security officials to improve upon reporting prac-\\ntices to address prisoner abuse? \\nAnswer. While INL programs are designed to create accountability with correc-\\ntional system leadership I understand there are ongoing Embassy efforts to in-\\ncrease engagement with Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire leadership to increase famili-\\narity with policies and practices that are consistent with international human rights \\nlaw. \\nIn the State Department\\u2019s 2022 Report on Trafficking in Persons Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\nis currently Tier 2 showing efforts to improve towards meeting minimum require-\\nments to eliminate trafficking. However the Government is lacking in key areas \\nsuch as a lack of law enforcement training to investigate and identify victims na-\\ntional anti-trafficking committee meetings did not meet or coordinate anti-traf-\\nficking activities and the Government did not allocate a dedicated budget for the \\nanti-trafficking committee for the third year in a row. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you work with government officials to implement \\na specialized system of training to develop anti-trafficking law enforcement officers? \\nAnswer. Noting that Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire acknowledges the problem of human trafficking \\nand has demonstrated political will to combat it with several high-profile events \\nI am committed to supporting their efforts to combat this devastating practice. \\nQuestion. What steps would you take to encourage the host government to address \\nthe lack of resources allocated to the anti-trafficking committee in order to facilitate \\nmore operational capacity? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to advocate for increased Government of \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire investment in its anti-trafficking committee. Simultaneously I commit \\nto supporting the growth and development of anti-trafficking civil society organiza-\\ntions (CSOs). Through advocacy to the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and creative ef-\\nforts to spotlight effective Ivorian anti-trafficking CSOs our Embassy will continue \\nto support awareness and action to combat trafficking. I will encourage expanded \\npartnership with the anti-trafficking committee and other institutions committed to \\naddress this scourge. \\nQuestion. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has constitutional provisions for freedom of religious belief \\nand prohibition of religious discrimination as well as emphasizing religious toler-\\nance as fundamental to the nation\\u2019s unity. Religious leaders and local law enforce-\\nment partner with subnational governmental groups to try to prevent violent extre-\\nmism and protect communities from the growing threat of terrorism in the Sahel \\nregion. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed how could you work with these groups to continue to develop rela-\\ntions that counter violent extremism in the region? \\nAnswer. Faith-based communities have a powerful role to play in supporting \\ndemocratic institutions advancing human rights and promoting peace. If confirmed \\nI will work to support these efforts through positive U.S. messaging direct support \\nfor cooperation and coordination between these parties and funding for innovative \\nanti-extremism strategies. I will continue my predecessor\\u2019s ongoing engagement \\nwith religious leaders across faith communities to ensure open communication about \\nthe threat of violent extremism respect for human rights and global health. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00052\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n53 \\nQuestion. Embassy officials have met with the Government to discuss the state \\nof religious freedom and tolerance to gather insight on levels of violence or discrimi-\\nnation and promote cooperation amongst Christian and Muslim groups. \\n\\u2022 What is your assessment of the state of religious tolerance in the country? \\nAnswer. The constitution provides for freedom of religious belief and worship con-\\nsistent with law and order and prohibits religious discrimination. It emphasizes \\nthat religious tolerance is fundamental to the nation\\u2019s unity peace reconciliation \\nand social cohesion and forbids speech that encourages religious hatred. Religious \\nleaders regularly come together for issues related to social cohesion and public \\nhealth. For example they partnered with local law enforcement and subnational \\ngovernment leadership on security matters to prevent violent extremism and protect \\ntheir communities from the growing terrorist threat emanating from the Sahel. \\nQuestion. How could you continue to build upon these discussions with the host \\ngovernment to further improve religious tolerance? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I would continue our long history of engaging at all levels \\nof Embassy Abidjan with various religious communities to demonstrate U.S. support \\nfor religious tolerance. I will also use public diplomacy including around religious \\nholidays to demonstrate respect for all faiths. \\nQuestion. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) in the State \\nDepartment\\u2019s bureau of International Organizations is leading a whole-of-govern-\\nment effort to identify recruit and install qualified independent personnel at the \\nU.N. including in elections for specialized bodies like the International Tele-\\ncommunications Union (ITU). There is an American candidate Doreen Bogdan-Mar-\\ntin who if elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. \\nShe is in a tough race that will require early consistent engagement across capitals \\nand within the U.N. member states. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed do you commit to demarching the Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire Government and \\nany other counterparts necessary to encourage their support of Ms. Bogdan- \\nMartin? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to demarching the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire \\nand others in support of Ms. Bogdan-Martin. It is vital that we continue to engage \\non behalf of American candidates in multilateral institutions. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how can you work with the International Organizations \\n(IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify recruit and install qualified Ameri-\\ncans in positions like the Junior Program Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.? \\nAnswer. I have always encouraged Americans of all backgrounds to pursue work \\nin the international community recruiting new members of the U.S. Foreign Service \\nwhile also encouraging opportunities to serve in the U.N. and in other international \\norganizations. If confirmed I will continue to recruit and mentor to retain excellent \\nofficers in our unique careers. I have extensive experience coordinating with the IO \\nBureau to advocate for U.S. candidates in senior positions in the U.N. and its spe-\\ncialized agencies. At the U.S. Mission to the African Union we used this multilat-\\neral platform to advocate for U.S. policy priorities and American candidates. If con-\\nfirmed I will continue to coordinate with the IO Bureau to encourage Americans \\nto secure more opportunities at every level of the U.N. and its specialized agencies. \\nI will also continue to recruit Americans to serve internationally including through \\nthe U.N. Junior Program Officer program to have more American leaders in these \\norganizations that are vital to advancing U.S. interests. \\nQuestion. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has a low rate of voting coincidence with the U.S. in the \\nU.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council. What is your assessment of \\nthis issue? \\nAnswer. Although African states find themselves in a difficult situation when it \\ncomes to voting patterns this is a problematic trend that must be addressed \\nthrough relationship building increased bilateral ties and effective short- and long- \\nterm messaging. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire was one of very few African countries to vote at least \\nthree times with the United States on Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine demonstrating \\ncourage and conviction. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what concrete actions can you take to engage with the \\nGovernment on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that would increase their vot-\\ning coincidence with the U.S.? \\nAnswer.

In May Secretary Blinken said that the People\\u2019s Republic of China is \\nthe \\u2018\\u2018only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and in-\\ncreasingly the economic diplomatic military and technological power to do it.\\u2019\\u2019 The \\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People\\u2019s \\nRepublic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in Xinjiang flood \\nour communities with fentanyl and emit by far the largest quantity of greenhouse \\ngases. With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry the CCP could \\nstop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose. \\n\\u2022 Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States? \\nAnswer. Certain activities by the People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Chinese \\nCommunist Party (CCP) represent a challenge to U.S. economic political and secu-\\nrity interests globally and on the African continent. The PRC has used its influence \\nabroad in ways that undermine laws agreements and institutions which has the \\neffect of undermining rule of law and democratic principles. Our engagement with \\nAfrica is neither influenced by nor a reaction to China or any other third party. \\nThe U.S. Strategy Toward Africa recognizes the tremendous opportunities that exist \\nto advance shared interests alongside our African partners. Secretary Blinken said \\non May 26 we will invest align and compete with the PRC to defend our interests \\nand build our vision for the future. If confirmed I will invest in our partnership \\nwith Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire; align our concerns including by highlighting the risks associated \\nwith PRC engagement that could impact Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s security democracy and \\nsovereignty and U.S. interests. I will ensure that our vision of regional security and \\nprosperity provides the basis for a positive U.S.-Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire partnership that com-\\npetes successfully with the type of relationship offered by the PRC. \\nQuestion. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities that are \\nbeneficial to U.S. interests? \\nAnswer. We are prepared to work together with the People\\u2019s Republic of China \\n(PRC) where our interests intersect in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and elsewhere and where it \\nis essential for global peace and prosperity. Issues like climate change the global \\ndrug trade and COVID\\u201319 directly threaten our prosperity and security and we \\nneed to work with the PRC\\u2014just as much as the PRC needs to work with us\\u2014to \\nsolve these problems without borders. This is especially true in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. \\nQuestion. If confirmed will you approve any joint activity with organizations or \\nrepresentatives from the People\\u2019s Republic of China in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I am prepared to work together with the People\\u2019s Republic \\nof China (PRC) where our interests intersect in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and remain in line \\nwith core U.S. values including where it is essential for global peace and prosperity. \\nIssues like climate change the global drug trade and COVID\\u201319 directly threaten \\nour prosperity and security and we need to work with the PRC\\u2014just as much as \\nthe PRC needs to work with us\\u2014to solve these problems without borders. As Sec-\\nretary Blinken has said we cannot allow the disagreements that divide us stop us \\nfrom moving forward on the priorities that demand that we work together for the \\ngood of our people and for the good of the world. \\nQuestion. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire like other African countries is dependent on food imports \\nfrom Russia and Ukraine. While the United States has diligently worked to release \\nUkrainian grain through means other than Black Sea ports currently under Russian \\nattack Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and other countries are struggling with the impact of reduced \\nfood resources. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire also uses Chinese technology for digital surveillance \\nraising human rights concerns. \\n\\u2022 How do you assess Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s efforts to secure reliable sources of food for \\nits people? \\nAnswer. Ivoirian authorities have imposed a set of temporary measures to control \\nrising living costs and improve food security including price ceilings on staple foods \\nand a suspension of custom duties on wheat imports. These measures will mostly \\nbenefit the poorest Ivoirians who spend a larger share of their incomes on essential \\ngoods.

How would you highlight to Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s Government the dangers of \\nusing Chinese technology? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will emphasize American technology and other options for \\nthe Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to consider as it expands its infrastructure to meet \\nthe needs of the Ivoirian people. We know the People\\u2019s Republic of China is deter-\\nmined to become the world\\u2019s technology leader by any means necessary and has a \\nwell-resourced and comprehensive plan to achieve that ambition. The State Depart-\\nment is working with allies and partners to build secure resilient and diverse sup-\\nply chains; to protect sensitive technologies data and critical infrastructure; and to \\nensure strategic competitors cannot exploit our own innovative ecosystems to gain \\nmilitary or national security advantage. \\nQuestion. What would be the impact to the United States of a prolonged food secu-\\nrity crisis in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work with public and private sector partners and \\nacross U.S. Government agencies to help Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire avert a prolonged food secu-\\nrity crisis. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has been experiencing a level of political stability for the \\npast decade that has enabled the country to make great economic progress and ef-\\nfectively address the country\\u2019s once daunting food insecurity and malnutrition \\nissues. A prolonged food security crisis could result in loss of life and productivity \\nand endanger Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s stability making it more vulnerable to insecurity \\ndemocratic backsliding and malign influence. A food security crisis would result in \\nan increased need for humanitarian and development assistance which could then \\nput a higher burden on the United States as one of the Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s most impor-\\ntant partners to advance sustainable development goals. Likewise much of the rest \\nof Sub-Saharan Africa could see similar struggles with a prolonged food security cri-\\nsis precipitating more instability in the region and loss of previous food security and \\nnutrition gains. A result could be increased needs for humanitarian assistance as \\nwell as other unforeseen consequences of increased food security-related instability. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what will you do to ensure that Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire reduces its \\ndependence on Russia for food and fertilizer so that it is more resilient to food \\nshocks in the future? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will prioritize partnerships to strengthen the agricultural \\nsector that supports the livelihoods of millions of Ivoirians. Investments by the \\nUnited States through initiatives like the McGovern-Dole school program in Co\\n\\u02c6te \\nd\\u2019Ivoire which feeds over 125000 children in rural northern areas every day help \\nreduce dependence on Russia. Resiliency to food shocks begins with consistent pro-\\ngramming that meets essential food security needs and draws from a state\\u2019s agricul-\\ntural strengths. If confirmed I will seek to develop and expand programs that har-\\nness and build upon Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s most traditional food crops such as yam cas-\\nsava and plantains that are geared towards increasing domestic food production \\nand security. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has tremendous potential to become a net food exporter \\nand I will work to identify productive partnership opportunities to further the \\nUnited States\\u2019 interests. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO JESSICA DAVIS BA BY SENATOR TODD YOUNG \\nQuestion. The State Department has a number of posts in its Bureau of African \\nAffairs that are classified as \\u2018\\u2018historically difficult to staff\\u2019\\u2019; if confirmed how would \\nyou engage the Foreign Service workforce to encourage qualified individuals to serve \\nin Abidjan or other posts in Africa? \\nAnswer. I believe that the best work comes from well-resourced teams that sup-\\nport one another towards achieving common goals and advancing U.S. policies.

If confirmed I will continue to support efforts to ensure meaningful family \\nemployment at Embassy Abidjan which helps with recruitment morale and to \\nclose staffing gaps at this historically difficult to staff post. \\nQuestion. With Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire as a signatory to Beijing\\u2019s Belt and Road initiative \\nhow do you see the trade relationship evolving between Beijing and Abidjan? \\nAnswer. If confirmed one of my highest priorities will be to deepen the trade rela-\\ntionship between the United States and Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire. The role of the People\\u2019s Re-\\npublic of China (PRC) in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s economy is growing and the Government \\nof Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire welcomes investment including from the PRC. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire imports \\nnearly $2.3 billion worth of PRC goods a year but exports only about $576 million \\nin Ivoirian goods to the PRC mostly raw rubber. Ivoirian complaints regarding \\nPRC- Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire trade mainly concern the quality of PRC workmanship and the \\nlack of technology transfer. In addition there is evidence that increased Chinese ac-\\ntivity has led to a greater demand for trafficked animals. The Ivoirians recently re-\\njected a PRC overture to begin negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as \\nofficials worried it would disturb Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s relationship with ECOWAS. I will \\nwork with our interagency team and Washington to leverage U.S. Government tools \\nto support American companies to demonstrate best practices and to make trade \\nwith the United States more attractive than our competitors. \\nPresident Ouattara and his ministers openly welcome American investment. They \\nremain very pro-American but are pragmatic considering the country\\u2019s massive need \\nfor foreign direct investment (FDI) resulting in an open-for-business attitude to-\\nwards the PRC and others. If confirmed I will continue to support the expansion \\nof U.S. investment in Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to provide an alternative to PRC offers. \\nQuestion. What kinds of opportunities and potential do you see for American com-\\npanies within the Ivoirian private sector and where should we first focus our ef-\\nforts? \\nAnswer. The Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is eager for more U.S. private sector in-\\nvestment. With total bilateral trade in 2021 almost $1.6 billion Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire is cur-\\nrently the United States\\u2019 largest francophone Africa trading partner and the United \\nStates is Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s fifth largest trading partner. The most promising areas for \\nU.S. investment are currently in energy including renewables construction equip-\\nment and material agro-processing agricultural services and products and tele-\\ncommunication equipment and services. \\nOpportunities in the energy sector are abundant. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has oil and gas re-\\nserves and has also committed to increase renewable energy generation to 42% by \\n2030. The Ivoirian Government is also focused on expanding infrastructure projects \\nto make the country\\u2019s economic growth more inclusive and not focused on the \\nAbidjan area in the South. Finally Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s leadership is anxious to improve \\nthe value chain capabilities for the country\\u2019s massive output of agricultural prod-\\nucts. The U.S. Government can use tools such as Prosper Africa to support U.S. and \\nIvoirian businesses in this area. Secretary Blinken met with Ivoirian Prime Min-\\nister Patrick Achi in March 2022 to discuss ways in which the United States and \\nCo\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire can strengthen the bilateral economic partnership. If confirmed I will \\nwork closely with private sector partners and the Government of Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire to \\nexpand opportunities for U.S. private investment. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD \\nSUBMITTED TO JESSICA DAVIS BA BY SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS \\nQuestion. What does Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire need to do to prevent the spread of violent ex-\\ntremism within its borders? What tools and lessons of the Global Fragility Act will \\nyou draw on to help the Ivoirian Government and society become resilient in the \\nface of these challenges? \\nAnswer. Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire must take a holistic approach to prevent the spread of vio-\\nlent extremism. Security investments alone are insufficient. Such an approach \\nshould include targeted investments in democratic governance private sector solu-\\ntions and social services as well as in the security sector.

Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire has taken progressive steps \\nto invest in the north through new social programs focused on youth major infra-\\nstructure development and expanding the presence of security forces in at-risk \\nareas for terrorist attacks. \\nIf confirmed I will work with various Ivoirian Government and civil society stake-\\nholders to ensure that the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability \\n(SPCPS) under the Global Fragility Act is aligned with Co\\n\\u02c6te d\\u2019Ivoire\\u2019s National De-\\nvelopment Plan and facilitates meaningful government-community cooperation. Spe-\\ncifically the tools offered by the SPCPS can reinforce local and national early warn-\\ning systems and action plans to prevent the spread of violent extremism; support \\nexisting community-led platforms such as civilian-military committees to foster \\ntrust between marginalized communities and security forces; professionalize law en-\\nforcement and other government officials to engender trust with the communities \\nthey serve; and strengthen legal capabilities to hold violent extremist actors ac-\\ncountable. \\nIf confirmed I will encourage the Government to continue these efforts and to ex-\\nplore opportunities including with the private sector for partnerships to expand \\nservices and livelihoods. I will lead our interagency team in Abidjan to use all of \\nour diplomatic development and defense tools to support the Government\\u2019s efforts \\nto build resilience to violent extremism in the northern region and throughout the \\ncountry. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD \\nSUBMITTED TO HON. LUCY TAMLYN BY SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ \\nQuestion. Is DRC on track to hold elections in 2023 as required? \\nAnswer. Under prevailing conditions there is no reason why free and fair elec-\\ntions cannot be held as scheduled in December 2023 in accordance with the DRC\\u2019s \\nconstitutional deadline. Some important steps have been taken but Congolese offi-\\ncials across the country will have to accelerate preparations\\u2014both technical and po-\\nlitical\\u2014over the next several months to ensure the elections are free and fair includ-\\ning in eastern DRC. \\nThe DRC conducted gubernatorial elections in May in 14 of 26 provinces which \\nwere largely peaceful and included accredited national and international observers \\nincluding U.S. Embassy staff and representatives from other diplomatic missions. \\nThis election was an encouraging if limited sign for the ability of DRC authorities \\nto conduct elections in December 2023. In June the DRC parliament adopted revi-\\nsions to the DRC\\u2019s 2006 electoral law but measures aimed at ensuring transparency \\nin 2023 and preventing the irregularities that marred previous election cycles failed \\nto pass. Key issues in the process ahead include voter registration the identification \\nof the voting centers publication of the electoral calendar the appropriation and re-\\nlease of an adequate budget and invitation and accreditation of electoral observers. \\nWhile there is no doubt that greater progress needs to be made particularly on po-\\nlitical measures there is still time for free and fair elections to be held. \\nQuestion. What is the U.S. doing to support timely credible transparent and \\npeaceful elections in DRC in 2023? \\nAnswer. One of the Administration\\u2019s top policy priorities in the DRC is to support \\nlong-term stability through free and fair elections. The Department continues to \\npress the DRC Government and National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) \\nto adhere to the planned electoral timeline to maximize opportunities to be trans-\\nparent on electoral processes and outcomes and to ensure an open political environ-\\nment for the Congolese people to express their views peacefully. Assistant Secretary \\nfor African Affairs Molly Phee and Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy \\nHuman Rights and Labor (DRL) Lisa Peterson both stressed this message in meet-\\nings with CENI President Denis Kadima during a visit to Washington D.C. in late \\nFebruary. \\nWe are employing the full range of foreign policy tools in support of the elections \\nin 2023. This includes international pressure in coordination with European and Af-\\nrican partners as well as the U.N.; public messaging; diplomatic engagement in-\\ncluding senior-level visits; and technical assistance to support a transparent and \\ncredible process. DRL is actively expanding its suite of human rights and democracy \\nprograms in the DRC to lay the groundwork for increased citizen participation in \\nand understanding of the electoral process. Total U.S. Government support for the \\nelections and election observation is over $13 million. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00057\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n58 \\nQuestion. How are these activities different from what we did in 2018 when U.S. \\nsupport for domestic election observers and other election support activity did not \\nresult in a timely transparent or credible process? \\nAnswer. Unlike in 2018 President Tshisekedi and his top aides have publicly \\ncommitted to conducting free and fair elections in accordance with constitutional \\ndeadlines. Although there are deficiencies the current President of the National \\nIndependent Electoral Commission (CENI) Denis Kadima has also committed to \\nwell-managed elections in 2023 that are free and fair. \\nEmbassy Kinshasa and other U.S. representatives have consistently messaged \\nthat the United States expects the DRC to conduct elections in accordance with con-\\nstitutional deadlines that are free and fair and that reflect the will of the Congolese \\npeople. The United States is working alongside other likeminded countries to ensure \\na consistent message on the importance of these elections to help consolidate DRC\\u2019s \\ndemocratic transition. USAID is providing technical support to CENI countering \\ndisinformation and improving access to accurate information about electoral proc-\\nesses and supporting civil society led civic and voter education. USAID is also \\nreadying plans to assist independent domestic and international observation efforts \\nto improve confidence in the integrity of the outcomes. The United States has also \\nencouraged President Tshisekedi to make a formal request to the United Nations \\nto provide logistical and technical support to the elections. \\nQuestion. Will you commit to briefing the committee on your election strategy 90 \\ndays after arriving at Post if confirmed? \\nAnswer. Yes I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to keep the com-\\nmittee apprised of developments. \\nQuestion. Under former President Kabila the DRC was characterized by human \\nrights abuses corruption and impunity. President Tshisekedi vowed to address \\nthese issues. Three years later however several senior military officers responsible \\nfor gross violations of human rights remain at their posts and corruption again ap-\\npears rampant. \\nHas the human rights situation and fight against corruption and impunity im-\\nproved since the 2018 elections? \\nAnswer. President Tshisekedi has taken steps to promote respect for human \\nrights. Since the beginning of his term he has freed Kabila-era political prisoners \\npromoted respect for human rights including for people living with disabilities and \\nvulnerable persons and affirmed the freedom of peaceful assembly. In July 2022 \\nthe Government of the DRC promulgated a new law on the protection of Indigenous \\nPeoples\\u2019 rights. In 2020 the DRC achieved the ranking of Tier 2 Watch List in the \\nannual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report after making key achievements that \\nyear. Despite enormous institutional hurdles including limited awareness of TIP \\nand an ineffective judicial system DRC\\u2019s law enforcement and victim protection au-\\nthorities have secured important victories in the fight against human trafficking. In \\nthe past two years the Government broke up a transnational child trafficking ring \\nconvicted perpetrators of sex trafficking in Kinshasa and launched a national TIP \\nawareness campaign. The Congolese military (FARDC) has taken significant and \\nsuccessful strides to eliminate the recruitment and use of children in its ranks. \\nSignificant challenges do remain in the DRC but unlike during the Kabila era \\nthe United States is the Tshisekedi administration\\u2019s partner of choice and it is \\naware that our partnership relies on respect for human rights. \\nQuestion. What actions will you take if confirmed to make it clear to the DRC \\nGovernment that respect for human rights and the rule of law are essential for \\nDRC\\u2019s future and DRC\\u2019s ability to partner with the U.S. and U.S. companies looking \\nto invest in DRC? \\nAnswer. If confirmed advancing the protection of human rights and the rule of \\nlaw would be among my highest priorities. We know that allegations of human \\nrights violations and abuses and corruption eat away at any prospects for the DRC \\nto emerge as a prosperous and stable country. Respect for human rights and a \\nstrong focus on anti-corruption efforts are in the DRC\\u2019s interest. Embassy Kinshasa \\nhas consistently stressed the importance of respecting human rights including free-\\ndom of expression (including for members of the press) and the right of peaceful as-\\nsembly. For eastern DRC especially the Embassy has continually and strongly \\nurged armed groups and Congolese security forces to end all human rights viola-\\ntions and abuses end all attacks on civilians and ensure that those responsible for \\nsuch acts be held accountable. The United States and the DRC also held its first \\nbilateral Human Rights Dialogue in 2021. If confirmed I would continue partnering \\nclosely with the DRC Government to make progress on these key issues. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00058\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n59 \\nQuestion. Preserving what is left of the Congo forest basin is essential for the \\nhealth of our planet. The DRC Government has previously emerged as a leader in \\nAfrica on preservation of the environment. In July however the DRC Government \\nannounced its intention to sell 30 oil blocks in forested areas. If drilling occurs in \\nthese areas it could release disastrous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. \\nUntil recently the DRC Government appeared committed to preserving the environ-\\nment and the Congo forest basin which is home to rainforest peat bogs and carbon \\nsinks essential for the health of the planet. In July however the DRC Government\\u2019s \\npolicy seemed to shift with the announcement of the sale of 30 oil and gas \\nprospecting blocks throughout the rainforest. \\n\\u2022 How do you explain this shift? \\nAnswer. The DRC Government is attempting to balance achieving long-term glob-\\nal climate goals such as their COP26 commitments with addressing immediate \\npressing development needs including poverty and hunger. Embassy Kinshasa is \\ndiscussing the auction of the oil and gas prospecting blocks with the Ministry of Hy-\\ndrocarbons the Ministry of the Environment and the Presidency urging that \\nverifiable environmental impact assessments be conducted prior to any oil explo-\\nration. In the past the Government has acknowledged the potential for oil in these \\nsensitive areas but has foregone plans to exploit potential reserves in the interest \\nof the environment. Embassy Kinshasa is hoping to partner with the DRC to pursue \\nalternative development pathways that help secure improved livelihoods for the \\nCongolese people and help DRC meet its climate and environmental commitments. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what will you do to work with the Congolese to balance \\nthe necessary preservation of what is left of Congo Forest basin and the DRC\\u2019s eco-\\nnomic development objectives and needs? \\nAnswer. In February 2021 in line with President Biden\\u2019s prioritization of combat-\\nting the climate crisis the U.S.-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace and Pros-\\nperity added \\u2018\\u2018Preservation of the Environment\\u2019\\u2019 to its core pillars. To advance his \\nenvironmental agenda President Tshisekedi elevated the position of Minister of the \\nEnvironment and Sustainable Development to one of four Vice-Prime Minister posi-\\ntions in the cabinet. To this role he appointed Eve Bazaiba an experienced activist \\nand politician. \\nThe DRC could contribute significantly to the fight against climate change if it \\nfollows President Tshisekedi\\u2019s declared intention to take bold steps to combat defor-\\nestation and strengthen environmental protections. The DRC is home to 47 percent \\nof Africa\\u2019s tropical rainforests. The U.S. Government has a wide range of programs \\nacross agencies to support both the necessary conservation of the Congo Basin forest \\nand the DRC\\u2019s economic development objectives and needs. A few examples include \\nthe SilvaCarbon program jointly funded with the Department of State and the U.S. \\nAgency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the U.S. Forest \\nService U.S. Geological Survey and other agencies which mobilizes private sector \\nfinance for activities aligned with forest conservation and restoration including \\nthrough carbon markets and results-based payments programs; USAID\\u2019s Central Af-\\nrican Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) that focuses on using a peo-\\nple-centered approach to biodiversity and habitat protection using protected areas \\n(PAs) as anchors for sustainable development fostering public private partnerships \\n(PPPs) for PA management and leveraging natural capital to promote green econo-\\nmies; and the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA) a \\nmulti-stakeholder forum created in 2011 to support the creation of conflict-free sup-\\nply chains from the DRC/Great Lakes region. The United States also engages with \\nother like-minded donor countries through the Congo Basin Forest Partnership \\nwhich helps coordinate conservation and sustainable management of Congo Basin \\nforest ecosystems. \\nIf confirmed I will leverage these programs and others to work with the Congo-\\nlese to balance the necessary preservation of sensitive areas of the Congo Forest \\nbasin and the DRC\\u2019s economic development objectives and needs. \\nQuestion. The recent re-emergence of the M23 rebel group has significantly desta-\\nbilized eastern DRC. In June the U.N. peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) reported \\nthat the M23 is surprisingly well armed and may outgun U.N. peacekeepers. U.N. \\nexperts reported that Rwandan troops are operating alongside M23 inside DRC. In \\naddition to executing civilians and displacing tens of thousands the group has shot \\ndown a U.N. helicopter killing U.N. troops. MONUSCO\\u2019s inability to effectively con-\\ntain M23 has heightened tensions between MONUSCO the Congolese people and \\nthe Congolese Government resulting in the tragic deaths of civilians and U.N. \\npeacekeepers. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00059\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n60 \\n\\u2022 The last time M23 emerged in DRC in 2012 they did so with Rwandan sup-\\nport. Do you agree that Rwandan support for M23 or the presence of Rwandan \\ntroops inside DRC is unacceptable? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. If confirmed should the United States speak out publicly against \\nRwanda\\u2019s support for the M23 and the presence of Rwandan troops in DRC? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. What steps is the Administration taking to reduce tensions between \\nMONUSCO and the Congolese and bolster MONUSCO\\u2019s effectiveness with regard \\nto combatting armed groups and providing civilian protection? \\nAnswer. I am deeply concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests have turned \\nviolent and included attacks on MONUSCO facilities and resulted in peacekeeper \\nand protester casualties. At the same time I was appalled by the July 31 shooting \\nof civilians by peacekeepers in Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General\\u2019s swift \\nresponse and strong statement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means \\nperfect but it is an essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern DRC. \\nFor decades the people of eastern DRC have suffered violence and insecurity pri-\\nmarily perpetrated in recent years by armed groups and sometimes by DRC\\u2019s own \\nsecurity forces. Corrupt networks have profited from the illicit exploitation of the \\nregion\\u2019s natural resources. Currently the M23 armed group with reported backing \\nby the Government of Rwanda is controlling territory near the Uganda border and \\nkilling civilians. Addressing the current crisis and the long-standing underlying \\nissues including the role of DRC\\u2019s neighbors is a priority for the State Department. \\nThe State Department has maintained steady engagement with senior host nation \\nofficials as well as key partners to encourage de-escalation of regional tensions the \\ntermination of the M23 offensive and progress on the demobilization of all armed \\ngroups. Secretary Blinken visited Kinshasa August 9-10 and Kigali August 10-11 \\nfollowing Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield\\u2019s travel August 4-5 to Uganda. The Bu-\\nreau of African Affairs\\u2019 Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Massinga discussed \\nthis issue in depth with the Foreign Ministers of the DRC Rwanda and Angola at \\nthe African Union (AU) mid-year coordination meeting in Lusaka from July 17-18. \\nOur key message is reinforcing the need to respect the DRC\\u2019s territorial integrity \\nand to terminate any proxy support to armed groups on all sides. The United States \\nis supportive of the African-led mediation efforts which have provided important \\nvenues for direct discussions among regional heads of state. If confirmed I will work \\nclosely with Washington to ensure that our engagement in Bujumbura Kampala \\nKigali and elsewhere is coordinated and responds to the regional dynamics that \\nhave long influenced the crisis. \\nMONUSCO has an important role to play in improving the situation. The U.N. \\nMission continues to carry out its mandate for the protection of civilians. If con-\\nfirmed I look forward to frequent interactions with MONUSCO leadership and close \\ncoordination with USUN as plans for the Mission\\u2019s transition move forward. \\nQuestion. Will you commit to briefing the committee 30 days after you arrive at \\npost on your assessment as to Rwandan presence in eastern Congo and its support \\nfor the M23 along with your recommendations for a set of diplomatic interventions \\nto address such if confirmed? \\nAnswer. Yes I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to keep the com-\\nmittee apprised of developments. \\nQuestion. The DRC has vast critical mineral reserves with reserves of cobalt a \\nnecessary component of batteries. As we turn to new technologies like electric vehi-\\ncles which require batteries to address the worsening climate crisis we face new \\nsecurity risks as China controls significant parts of clean energy supply chain. I am \\nespecially concerned about critical minerals in countries like the DRC as I outlined \\nin a letter I sent to Under Secretary Fernandez back in January. \\n\\u2022 What has State done to address the issues outlined in the letter I sent in Janu-\\nary about concerns with Chinese monopolization of critical minerals in the \\nDRC? \\nAnswer. The Department shares your concerns regarding the issues identified in \\nyour letter including the People\\u2019s Republic of China\\u2019s (PRC) concentrated influence \\nover mining and processing of clean-energy minerals. In May 2021 President \\nTshisekedi announced his intention to review mining deals with the PRC that in-\\nclude unfavorable terms for the DRC. This is an ongoing process and the United \\nStates has informed the DRC Government of our support for its decision to review \\ncontracts and pursue greater accountability in the sector.

Additionally during a visit to Washington DC by DRC Minister \\nof Mines Antoinette N\\u2019Samba Kalambayi in mid-March Under Secretary of State \\nfor Economic Growth Energy and the Environment Jose Fernandez signed with the \\nMinister a Memorandum of Understanding for the Department\\u2019s Bureau of Energy \\nResources to support Congolese efforts to strengthen sector governance and predict-\\nability for investors and maximize benefits of mineral resource development for the \\nCongolese people. \\nWe echo the long-standing calls from African capitals that PRC actions must re-\\nspect host country laws particularly regarding human and labor rights the rule of \\nlaw and protections for the environment. I am confident that in a level playing \\nfield U.S. companies will be a partner of choice for the DRC. By elevating environ-\\nmental social and governance standards and advancing mining-sector reforms in \\nkey countries we aim to reduce the advantage gained by PRC companies that ben-\\nefit from lax standards. By focusing on the entire supply chain from mining to re-\\nfining and processing to end uses as well as recycling we provide a holistic ap-\\nproach to securing the critical minerals needed for the energy transition. Finally \\nthrough increased information sharing attention to financing and minerals-focused \\ndiplomacy and commercial engagement we are taking a forward-looking rather than \\nreactive approach to working with likeminded countries with collective interests to-\\nward countering PRC influence and meeting climate and sustainability goals. \\nQuestion. What are the most important actions you have taken in your career to \\ndate to support democracy and human rights? What has been the impact of your \\nactions? \\nAnswer. As Ambassador in Benin I used my access to senior government officials \\nto highlight growing limitations on freedom of expression including for members of \\nthe press and to advocate for a regulatory framework which would not disadvan-\\ntage the independent media. As Ambassador in the Central African Republic I \\nworked closely with a group of like-minded countries and institutions to warn \\nagainst efforts to amend the constitution prior to the 2020 elections which could \\nhave potentially extended the term of the incumbent president. As Charge d\\u2019Affaires \\nin Sudan I repeatedly urged the highest authorities to release opposition leaders \\nheld under questionable detention terms cease violence against protestors and in-\\nvestigate allegations of gender-based violence. These actions made clear to the host \\ncountry interlocutors the importance of respect for human rights and democracy for \\nadvancing our partnership with the country in question and sent a clear message \\nto human rights defenders that we would stand with them. \\nQuestion. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy or demo-\\ncratic development in DRC? These challenges might include obstacles to \\nparticipatory and accountable governance and institutions rule of law authentic po-\\nlitical competition civil society human rights and press freedom. Please be as spe-\\ncific as possible. \\nAnswer. The most pressing challenge to democracy and democratic development \\nin the DRC is the protracted insecurity in the East. It is the overriding concern of \\nthe DRC Government and public with increased calls from civil society for greater \\nU.S. engagement. In May 2021 to deliver on his promise to restore security in east-\\nern DRC President Tshisekedi declared a \\u2018\\u2018State of Siege\\u2019\\u2019\\u2014effectively martial law\\u2014 \\nin two of the most troubled provinces North Kivu and Ituri installing military gov-\\nernors and ramping up Congolese military (FARDC) operations against ISIS-DRC \\nand armed groups in the region. Reports of human rights violations and abuses \\nhave accompanied the State of Siege. The U.N. and human rights groups have docu-\\nmented continued violations including extrajudicial killings by FARDC and police \\nwhile military governments have restricted civil society and political activists and \\nprosecuted some for criticizing the State of Siege. Despite President Tshisekedi\\u2019s ef-\\nforts to pursue constructive relationships with eastern neighbors the resurgence of \\nthe March 23 Movement (M23) armed group with reported backing by the Govern-\\nment of Rwanda has strained DRC-Rwanda relations to crisis levels.

Preparations are late in large part due to the delayed formation of a new \\nCENI leadership team. A new CENI board took office in October 2021 led by Presi-\\ndent Denis Kadima. Since his appointment Kadima has earned cautious praise \\nfrom erstwhile opponents for frank and open communication and indications of inde-\\npendence but broader concerns on CENI management and integrity persist. A re-\\nvised electoral law promulgated in July includes slight improvements for trans-\\nparency and gender; however a series of broader proposed reforms were rejected by \\nTshisekedi\\u2019s Sacred Union supermajority further fanning opposition concerns about \\nelectoral process. \\nQuestion. What steps will you take\\u2014if confirmed\\u2014to support democracy in DRC? \\nWhat do you hope to accomplish through these actions? What are the potential im-\\npediments to addressing the specific obstacles you have identified? \\nAnswer. We know that democracy is more than just free and fair elections and \\nwe are employing the full range of foreign policy tools in support of the elections \\nin 2023 given their critical importance to the DRC\\u2019s democratic trajectory. This in-\\ncludes international pressure in coordination with European and African partners \\nas well as the U.N.; public messaging; diplomatic engagement including senior-level \\nvisits; and technical assistance to support a transparent and credible process. The \\nDepartment continues to press the DRC Government and National Independent \\nElectoral Commission (CENI) to adhere to the planned electoral timeline to maxi-\\nmize opportunities to be transparent on electoral processes and outcomes and to en-\\nsure an open political environment for the Congolese people to express their views \\npeacefully. Secretary Blinken also stressed the need for free fair transparent and \\non-time election during his visit. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Molly Phee \\nand Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy Human Rights and Labor (DRL) \\nLisa Peterson both stressed this message in meetings with CENI President Denis \\nKadima during his visit to Washington DC in late February. \\nDRL is actively expanding its suite of human rights and democracy programs in \\nthe DRC to lay the groundwork for increased citizen participation in and under-\\nstanding of the electoral process. Ensuring the success of commitments on the elec-\\ntions process will require sustained attention to financial logistical technical and po-\\nlitical challenges. USAID is the largest donor working in elections and is currently \\nthe only donor providing technical support to CENI. Recently USAID announced $13 \\nmillion to finance international and domestic election observation and other election \\nactivities. More broadly the Department seeks to engage the DRC on supporting its \\ndemocratic aspirations through its participation in the Summit for Democracy the \\nU.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and bilateral Human Rights Dialogue. \\nIf confirmed I will leverage and expand these efforts where possible to support \\ndemocracy in DRC. Through these actions I hope to see DRC on a positive trajec-\\ntory that enables it to realize its democracy and its vast potential for the benefit \\nof the Congolese and American people as well as Central Africa and the world. \\nQuestion. How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources at your dis-\\nposal including the Democracy Commission Small Grants program and other \\nsources of State Department and USAID funding to support democracy and govern-\\nance and what will you prioritize in processes to administer such assistance? \\nAnswer. U.S. Government assistance resources including the Democracy Commis-\\nsion Small Grants program and other sources of State Department and USAID \\nfunding are important tools to support democracy human rights and governance \\n(DRG). DRG programs strengthen the ability of the Government of the DRC and \\ncivil society organizations to deliver basic services mobilize domestic resources and \\nencourage greater citizen participation in political processes. U.S. assistance sup-\\nports free and fair elections improves transparent and accountable government \\nprocesses and rule of law and improves access to information so that citizens may \\nparticipate fully in the democratic process and make more informed decisions. DRG \\nprograms contribute to citizen\\u2019s empowerment to hold institutions accountable and \\neffectiveness of public and private institutions to deliver public services. If con-\\nfirmed I will leverage these resources to support democracy respect for human \\nrights and good governance. If confirmed my priorities will include strengthening \\ntransparency and electoral administration; improving civic and voter education; em-\\npowering the population including women and youth to meaningfully participate \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00062\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n63 \\nin elections; and helping marginalized communities to understand and access polit-\\nical processes. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to meet with civil society members human \\nrights and other non-governmental organizations in the U.S. and with local human \\nrights NGOs and other members of civil society in DRC? What steps will you take \\nto pro-actively address efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil society via legal \\nor regulatory measures? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to meet with civil society members human rights \\nand other NGOs in the United States and with local human rights NGOs and other \\nmembers of civil society in DRC. \\nEmbassy Kinshasa regularly meets and engages with NGOs and civil society \\ngroups hosting roundtables and leveraging these relationships for outreach and to \\nadvance policy goals. Embassy Kinshasa has continually engaged with counterparts \\nin Ministries of Human Rights Justice Defense Interior and Communications to \\ndiscuss human rights issues including freedom of expression (including for members \\nof the press) and the right of peaceful assembly. If confirmed I will continue this \\nengagement and expand where possible to proactively address any efforts by the \\nDRC Government to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil society via legal or regu-\\nlatory measures. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to meet with democratically oriented polit-\\nical opposition figures and parties? What steps will you take to encourage genuine \\npolitical competition? Will you advocate for access and inclusivity for women mi-\\nnorities and youth within political parties? \\nAnswer. Embassy Kinshasa regularly meets with democratically oriented political \\nopposition figures and parties both to seek their perspectives and to make clear \\nthat the U.S. priority is for the DRC to conduct free and fair elections that reflect \\nthe will of the Congolese people in accordance with constitutional deadlines. Em-\\nbassy Kinshasa has also continually engaged with relevant ministries to advocate \\nfor specific measures to encourage genuine political competition including revisions \\nto the electoral law aimed at ensuring transparency and the invitation and accredi-\\ntation of electoral observers. Total U.S. Government support for the elections and \\nelection observation is over $13 million. \\nIf confirmed I commit to continuing these efforts and expand them where pos-\\nsible and to meet with democratically oriented political opposition figures and par-\\nties. If confirmed I will advocate for access and inclusivity for women minorities \\nand youth within political parties. \\nQuestion. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with DRC on freedom \\nof the press and address any government efforts designed to control or undermine \\npress freedom through legal regulatory or other measures? Will you commit to \\nmeeting regularly with independent local press in DRC? \\nAnswer.

Yes. \\nQuestion. What challenges do the lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer \\n(LGBTQ) people face in DRC? \\nAnswer. Legally LGBTQI+ status or conduct is not criminalized in the DRC but \\nthe law also does not expressly protect LGBTQI+ persons; some LGBTQI+ persons \\nhave been subjected to selective enforcement of \\u2018\\u2018public indecency\\u2019\\u2019 mechanisms that \\nare not applied to heterosexual adults.

LGBTQI+ activists \\nassert that other human rights organizations exclude LGBTQI+ rights organiza-\\ntions due either to religious belief or a belief that LGBTQI+ rights are not human \\nrights. \\nLGBTQI+ persons are vulnerable within the health system. LGBTQI+ activists re-\\nported that there were many cases of \\u2018\\u2018corrective\\u2019\\u2019 rape against both men and \\nwomen. When the survivors went to a health clinic for care they were either re-\\njected for being LGBTQI+ or the staff at the health clinic practiced so-called \\u2018\\u2018con-\\nversion therapy\\u2019\\u2019 practices and tried to \\u2018\\u2018dissuade\\u2019\\u2019 them from being LGBTQI+. \\nQuestion. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ people in DRC? \\nAnswer.

If confirmed I also commit \\nto engaging with other like-minded Embassies to create a coalition that can take \\nsteps to advocate for the protection and inclusion of members of the LGBTQI+ com-\\nmunity encourage the inclusion of LGBTQI+ identity groups in the broader human \\nrights community in the DRC and discuss the human rights of members of the \\nLGBTQI+ community with religious leaders. \\nQuestion. Will you commit if confirmed to ensuring that you fully brief members \\nof congress and/or their staff each time you are in Washington for visits or consulta-\\ntions during your tenure as Ambassador to DRC? \\nAnswer. Yes I will work with the Bureau of Legislative Affairs to keep the com-\\nmittee apprised of developments. \\nQuestion. Last week I convened a hearing on the important work of the State De-\\npartment\\u2019s Chief Diversity Officer and the important role diversity equity inclu-\\nsion and accessibility efforts play in maintaining our countries\\u2019 competitive edge on \\nthe global stage. How do you anticipate fostering diversity equity inclusion and \\naccessibility at Embassy Kinshasa? \\nAnswer. In June 2020 Embassy Kinshasa established a Diversity Equity Inclu-\\nsion and Accessibility (DEIA) Council. A survey conducted by the council revealed \\na desire for increased mentorship at the Mission especially among locally employed \\nstaff as well as concerns about weak social and collegial bonds between locally em-\\nployed staff and U.S. Direct Hires (USDH). In response the DEIA Council created \\nprogramming to bring the community together using Pride Month as a trial run. \\nSince these first steps the DEIA council has strengthened locally employed staff \\nunity by assisting with the local staff committee leadership elections as well as \\nstrengthened Congolese-American bonds within the Embassy through new social \\nprogramming focused on sharing local meals and stories. To address the demand for \\nmentorship Embassy Kinshasa instituted a mission-wide mentorship program and \\nput an emphasis on greater cross-cultural activities. \\nLooking after the safety of the Embassy community and ensuring that all Amer-\\nican and locally employed staff members can flourish and bring their best to the job \\nin an environment where they feel included and equal is my highest priority as a \\nleader. If confirmed I will prioritize recruiting and retaining staff to meet our mis-\\nsion\\u2019s objectives supporting the physical and mental health of the Embassy commu-\\nnity and setting expectations for how to accomplish mission priorities while main-\\ntaining work/life balance. If confirmed I commit to strong two-way communication \\nwith all Mission personnel including locally employed staff on this subject. \\nQuestion. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote diversity equity \\ninclusion and accessibility while also combating racism discrimination and in-\\nequality among locally employed staff in DRC? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work closely with Embassy Kinshasa\\u2019s Diversity Eq-\\nuity Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Council to promote their efforts and make \\nclear that combatting racism discrimination and inequality for all members of the \\nmission is a priority for me and my leadership team. If confirmed I look forward \\nto fostering the council\\u2019s mentorship program and participating in cross-cultural ac-\\ntivities. Ensuring that all members of the mission team can flourish and bring their \\nbest to the job in an environment where they feel included and equal is my highest \\npriority as a leader.

How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise knowledge \\nand capacity to meet our foreign policy goals? \\nAnswer. Our locally employed staff and other local partners are invaluable re-\\nsources to implement U.S. foreign policy objectives. Their local expertise knowledge \\nand capacity are essential to understanding the dynamics in DRC. If confirmed I \\nwill rely on this expertise to maximize our impact.

LUCY TAMLYN BY SENATOR JAMES E. RISCH \\nQuestion. What is your perspective on the situation in Eastern Congo and the role \\nof the United States in addressing the persistent insecurity challenges and complex \\nregional dynamics both bilaterally and through multilateral organizations namely \\nthe U.N. Peacekeeping Mission MONUSCO? \\nAnswer. For decades the people of eastern DRC have suffered violence and inse-\\ncurity primarily perpetrated in recent years by armed groups and sometimes by \\nDRC\\u2019s own security forces. Corrupt networks have profited from the illicit exploi-\\ntation of the region\\u2019s natural resources. Currently the M23 armed group allegedly \\nsupported by Rwanda is controlling territory near the Uganda border and killing ci-\\nvilians. Addressing the current crisis and the long-standing underlying issues in-\\ncluding the role of DRC\\u2019s neighbors is a priority for the State Department. We have \\nmaintained steady engagement with senior host nation officials as well as key part-\\nners to encourage de-escalation of regional tensions the termination of the M23 of-\\nfensive and progress on the demobilization of all armed groups. Secretary Blinken \\nwill visit Kinshasa August 9-10 and Kigali August 10-11 following Ambassador \\nThomas-Greenfield\\u2019s travel August 4-5 to Uganda. The Bureau of African Affairs\\u2019 \\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary Massinga discussed this issue in depth with \\nthe Foreign Ministers of DRC Rwanda and Angola at the African Union (AU) mid- \\nyear coordination meeting in Lusaka from July 17-18. Our key message is rein-\\nforcing the need to respect the DRC\\u2019s territorial integrity and to terminate any \\nproxy support to armed groups on all sides. The United States is supportive of the \\nAfrican-led mediation efforts which have provided important venues for direct dis-\\ncussions among regional heads of state. If confirmed I will work closely with Wash-\\nington to ensure that our engagement in Bujumbura Kampala Kigali and else-\\nwhere is coordinated and responds to the regional dynamics that have long influ-\\nenced the crisis. \\nMONUSCO has an important role to play in improving the situation. The U.N. \\nMission continues to carry out its mandate for the protection of civilians. I am deep-\\nly concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests have turned violent and included \\nattacks on MONUSCO facilities and resulted in peacekeeper and protester casual-\\nties. At the same time I was appalled by the July 31 shooting of civilians by peace-\\nkeepers in Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General\\u2019s swift response and strong \\nstatement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means perfect but it is \\nan essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern DRC. If confirmed I \\nlook forward to frequent interactions with MONUSCO leadership and close coordi-\\nnation with USUN as plans for the Mission\\u2019s transition move forward. \\nQuestion. What lessons were learned from the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak and \\nmore recent experiences with COVID\\u201319 in DRC that we must apply to future out-\\nbreaks of infectious disease in DRC? How will you approach coordinating multiple \\nU.S. departments and agencies responding to such an outbreak as U.S. Ambas-\\nsador? \\nAnswer. The Congolese international health professionals NGOs and U.S. Gov-\\nernment responders all made heroic contributions to defeat the 2018-2020 Ebola \\noutbreak in eastern DRC\\u2014the second largest in history.

With U.S. Government sup-\\nport the DRC has contained six Ebola outbreaks in the past four years alone de-\\nclaring the most recent outbreak over in July. \\nIf confirmed I will work to maintain the U.S. role as the DRC\\u2019s most trusted part-\\nner on health. Our contributions to the 2018-2020 Ebola response were a natural \\nexpansion of our longstanding support for the Congolese health system. The United \\nStates has provided over $1.7 billion in health assistance to the DRC over the past \\n20 years. In 2019 the DRC was designated as a U.S. Global Health Security Agenda \\n(GHSA) intensive support partner country increasing the DRC\\u2019s longer-term pre-\\nparedness capacity to combat health-security threats. Since September 2021 the \\nUnited States has provided over 3.9 million COVID\\u201319 vaccine doses with the peo-\\nple of the DRC both in partnership with COVAX and through the African Union\\u2019s \\nAfrican Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT). \\nU.S. support to the Congolese health sector has been a whole-of-government ap-\\nproach bringing together the Departments of State Defense Health and Human \\nServices (HHS) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID. If confirmed I will \\nwork across all U.S. Government departments and agencies to respond to outbreaks \\nand strengthen Congolese health systems. As we did with previous outbreaks if con-\\nfirmed I would welcome CDC National Institute of Health (NIH) and USAID \\nhealth and disaster response experts to the DRC for quick engagement with our \\nCongolese and international organization partners. If confirmed I would support the \\nwide variety of U.S. Government health assistance programs. For example the CDC \\nhas trained more than 300 Congolese field epidemiologists \\u2018\\u2018disease detectives\\u2019\\u2019 who \\nrespond to COVID\\u201319 and other outbreaks. USAID led a public-private partnership \\nwith the Merieux Foundation to construct a state-of-the-art biomedical lab in east-\\nern DRC that serves as a regional lab to address global health issues such as Ebola \\nand COVID\\u201319. I understand more than one-third of the Congolese population is \\ncovered by U.S. Government programs in HIV/AIDS maternal and child health nu-\\ntrition malaria and TB interventions reaching at-risk communities. Outbreak re-\\nsponse requires constant vigilance and constant coordination and if confirmed I will \\nwork across U.S. Government partners to communicate and align for the most effec-\\ntive response. \\nQuestion. Many U.S. missions have been under enormous stress over the last few \\nyears in large part due to COVID. What is your understanding of morale through-\\nout Mission Kinshasa? \\nAnswer. U.S. Embassy Kinshasa is doing important work in a challenging envi-\\nronment. The Embassy is historically difficult to staff with multiple staffing vacan-\\ncies. This means many people are assuming the work of multiple employees working \\nin outdated inadequate office facilities. New facilities for our personnel are long \\noverdue; groundbreaking for construction of a New Embassy Compound to replace \\nand consolidate Kinshasa\\u2019s three separate compounds is expected to begin in early \\n2023. In the meantime Embassy Kinshasa is pursuing upgrades across its three \\ncurrent sites. Infrastructure challenges such as telecommunications are very real \\nfor both U.S. and local personnel. Travel times to and from the United States also \\naffect our staff\\u2019s well-being. Embassy staff including locally employed staff face \\nphysical and mental health hazards including losses due to COVID\\u201319. \\nThroughout this team has shown great resilience. I understand Embassy \\nKinshasa prioritizes improving morale through the community liaison office\\u2019s out-\\nreach field trips town halls and social events for staff to connect with leadership. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Kinshasa? \\nAnswer. Looking after the safety of the embassy community and ensuring that \\neach and every American and local employee can flourish and bring his or her best \\nto the job in an environment free of harassment and discrimination is my highest \\npriority as a leader. If confirmed I will prioritize recruiting and retaining staff to \\nmeet our mission\\u2019s objectives supporting the physical and mental health of the Em-\\nbassy community and setting expectations for how to accomplish mission priorities \\nwhile maintaining work/life balance. I commit to strong two-way communication \\nwith all Mission personnel including locally employed staff on this subject. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to create unified mission and vision at Mission \\nKinshasa? \\nAnswer.

Management is a key responsibility for chiefs of mission. How would \\nyou describe your management style? \\nAnswer. My management style starts with listening to individuals understanding \\ntheir strengths and communicating my expectations clearly. I seek to ensure that \\nall staff have the support resources and training necessary to do their jobs. I also \\nseek to ensure that staff understand their responsibilities to do their best every day \\nand adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior in an environment of re-\\nspect. If confirmed I will bring special attention to ensuring that new entrants and \\nfirst-time section heads have the support and mentoring necessary to succeed. \\nQuestion. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to berate subordi-\\nnates either in public or private? \\nAnswer. No. \\nQuestion. How do you envision your leadership relationship with your deputy \\nchief of mission? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will collaborate closely with and rely on my deputy chief \\nof mission for strategic planning counsel management of personnel and implemen-\\ntation of U.S. activities and policy engagement to accomplish strategic objectives. If \\nconfirmed I will work with my deputy chief of mission to articulate and maintain \\nhigh ethical standards and create a culture of diversity inclusion and respect. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what leadership responsibilities do you intend to entrust \\nto your deputy chief of mission? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will ask the deputy chief of mission to ensure coordination \\nand collaboration across sections and agencies to support Integrated Country Strat-\\negy (ICS) objectives. I will ask the deputy chief of mission to oversee post manage-\\nment with a focus on workforce planning and performance. I will also ask the dep-\\nuty chief of mission to lead recruitment efforts for our embassy positions and work \\nwith other agencies to ensure that their personnel feel fully integrated into Embassy \\nKinshasa\\u2019s policy formulation and implementation. If confirmed I will collaborate \\nclosely with the deputy chief of mission on policy implementation and ensure that \\nin my absence the deputy chief of mission has the knowledge skills and confidence \\nto fully take on the responsibilities of the chief of mission. \\nQuestion. In order to create and continue employee excellence at the Department \\naccurate and direct employee evaluation reports (EERs) for Foreign Service Officers \\nare imperative though often lacking. Do you believe that it is important to provide \\nemployees with accurate constructive feedback on their performances in order to \\nencourage improvement and reward those who most succeeded in their roles? \\nAnswer. Yes I do. \\nQuestion. If confirmed would you support and encourage clear accurate and di-\\nrect feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward high achiev-\\ners? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. It is imperative that U.S. diplomats get outside of posts abroad to meet \\nwith local actors including host government officials non-government organizations \\nand fellow foreign diplomats stationed in the DRC. In your opinion do U.S. dip-\\nlomats get outside of our embassy walls enough to accomplish fully their missions? \\nAnswer. Mission Kinshasa will be most effective if it can engage with Congolese \\npopulations outside of the capital while respecting the safety standards determined \\nby embassy security personnel. Despite limited infrastructure in the largest country \\nin sub-Saharan Africa Embassy Kinshasa staff routinely overcome significant \\nlogistical challenges to travel outside of the capital to engage DRC Government offi-\\ncials civil society international organizations nongovernmental organizations \\nmedia and members of the international community throughout the country. I un-\\nderstand Embassy Kinshasa\\u2019s Eastern Congo Unit for example travels monthly to \\nthe East to among other things provide U.S. Government oversight for the $1.16 \\nbillion U.N. peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO). USAID officers travel countrywide \\nto oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. development and humanitarian as-\\nsistance. This travel is critical to ensuring a full understanding of the political eco-\\nnomic and security challenges in this zone which has been a flashpoint for conflict. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00067\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n68 \\nOther section personnel need to travel to learn about consular economic and polit-\\nical issues across the DRC and to provide oversight of U.S. assistance. In my pre-\\nvious assignments I have made sure that a robust regional security officer-approved \\ntravel plan was fully integrated into mission planning. I understand that Embassy \\nKinshasa\\u2019s Travel Security Working Group routinely evaluates security conditions \\nthroughout the country to determine suitability for mission travel and RSO puts \\nin place security mitigation measures to overcome security challenges. If confirmed \\nI intend to continue these best practices. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. diplomats to better \\naccess all local populations? \\nAnswer. If confirmed and as security and health conditions permit I will encour-\\nage U.S. diplomats to engage actively broadly and in-person with local populations \\nin and outside Kinshasa. If confirmed I will encourage active engagement through \\nsocial and virtual media to supplement this outreach. If confirmed I intend to travel \\nregularly throughout the DRC and use those visits to facilitate contacts for the rest \\nof my team. \\nQuestion. Public diplomacy is an important aspect of U.S. foreign policy efforts. \\nWhat is the public diplomacy environment like in the DRC? \\nAnswer. The Congolese public has embraced social media and public diplomacy \\nand in turn these have been strategic tools for advancing U.S. policy objectives and \\namplifying key messages. For example following President Felix Tshisekedi\\u2019s April \\n2019 visit to Washington the United States and DRC launched a \\u2018\\u2018Privileged Part-\\nnership for Peace and Prosperity\\u2019\\u2019 with a fifth \\u2018\\u2018P\\u2019\\u2019 (Preservation of the Environ-\\nment) added in February 2021. Over the years #PP4PP then #PP4PPP has become \\nnot just a hashtag but the signature framework for strengthening U.S.-DRC ties \\nadvancing common values and objectives and capturing comprehensive bilateral en-\\ngagement and activities. If confirmed I am committed to using public diplomacy as \\none of the many tools to connect with Congolese populations and advance U.S. for-\\neign policy. \\nOur colleagues at Embassy Kinshasa regularly use our network of American \\nSpaces in Kinshasa Matadi Lubumbashi Goma to support programming (virtual \\nand in person) to extend our reach. Embassy Kinshasa\\u2019s LOBA USA podcast now \\nin its second season is available online and broadcast on 45 community radio sta-\\ntions throughout the country. The Embassy leverages its robust network of ex-\\nchange alumni through alumni engagement grants and activities. Our cultural pro-\\ngramming has partnered with popular music stars to amplify strategic priorities \\nsuch as COVID vaccination and conflict resolution. Finally our innovative use of \\nvirtual English instruction in conjunction with our spaces has reached a new gen-\\neration of Congolese youth. \\nQuestion. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face there? \\nAnswer. The DRC\\u2019s population is overwhelmingly young and many either do not \\nhave access to quality education or must leave school because of economic hardship. \\nTelecommunications infrastructure is poor. The limited access to internet or other \\ntelecommunications infrastructure by many Congolese limits the opportunities for \\nand impact of virtual engagements which would be especially valuable in a country \\nas large as DRC where travel for in-person engagements is often difficult. Women \\nin particular often do not have access to technology. The difficult educational land-\\nscape also impacts the acquisition of English which in turn impacts the ability of \\nEmbassy Kinshasa to leverage opportunities such as exchanges or study abroad pro-\\ngrams that require English proficiency.

If confirmed do you commit to talking as openly as you can to Mission \\nKinshasa personnel? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. In the State Department\\u2019s 2022 Human Rights report the Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo (DRC) was noted as having numerous significant human rights \\nissues such as unlawful killings disappearances torture political prisoners issues \\nof judiciary independence serious abuses in conflict to include civilian harm en-\\nforced abductions use of child soldiers restrictions of expression corruption and \\nmore. If confirmed do you commit to directly addressing these issues with the host \\ngovernment? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how could you work with the DRC international organiza-\\ntions and NGOs to improve the human rights situation in the country? \\nAnswer. If confirmed the human rights and democracy agenda would be among \\nmy highest priorities. We know that allegations of human rights violations and \\nabuses and corruption eat away at any prospects for the DRC to emerge as a pros-\\nperous and stable country. Respect for human rights and a strong focus on anti-cor-\\nruption efforts are in the DRC\\u2019s interest. I understand the Embassy has consistently \\nstressed the importance of respecting human rights including freedom of expression \\n(including for members of the press) and the right of peaceful assembly. For eastern \\nDRC especially I understand the Embassy has continually and strongly urged \\narmed groups and Congolese security forces to end all human rights violations and \\nabuses end all attacks on civilians and ensure that those responsible for such acts \\nbe held accountable. The United States and the DRC also held its first bilateral \\nHuman Rights Dialogue in 2021. If confirmed I would continue partnering closely \\nwith the DRC Government to make progress on these key issues. \\nQuestion. In the State Department\\u2019s 2022 Trafficking in Persons report the DRC \\nremained on the Tier 2 watch list for not meeting the minimum standards for the \\nelimination of trafficking. The Government did not demonstrate increasing efforts \\ncompared with previous reporting periods; the Congolese National Army (FARDC) \\nofficers unlawfully recruited and used children including in combat roles; authori-\\nties penalized victims of acts traffickers compelled them to commit; no anti-traf-\\nficking legislation was drafted for a third straight year; and only due to a written \\nplan that if implemented would constitute a significant effort to eliminate traf-\\nficking was the DRC granted a waiver from being downgraded to Tier 3. If con-\\nfirmed how could you work with the DRC to implement its written plan? \\nAnswer. The United States is the Tshisekedi administration\\u2019s partner of choice \\nand it is aware that our partnership relies on respect for human rights including \\ndoing all they can to hold traffickers criminally accountable protect trafficking vic-\\ntims and prevent trafficking in persons. Through USAID\\u2019s Counter Trafficking in \\nPerson\\u2019s $3 million activity implemented by the Organization for International Mi-\\ngration (IOM) the U.S. Government continues to work with the Tshisekedi adminis-\\ntration\\u2019s Agency for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons other government in-\\nstitutions the judiciary law enforcement and civil society organizations to imple-\\nment the DRC\\u2019s National Strategy on Countering Trafficking in Persons. This in-\\ncludes strengthening the DRC Government\\u2019s ability to collect data investigate and \\nprosecute traffickers protect and provide services to victims of trafficking and sen-\\nsitize the public and officials to trafficking in persons in the DRC. State and USAID \\nhave also supported the DRC Government\\u2019s comprehensive draft legislation on traf-\\nficking in persons. USG agencies continue to advocate at all levels of government \\nfor its immediate passage. \\nFollowing the DRC\\u2019s third consecutive Tier 2 Watch List ranking in 2022 it will \\nbe subject to an automatic downgrade to Tier 3 in the 2023 TIP Report if it does \\nnot meet the criteria for an upgrade to Tier 2 or Tier 1. If confirmed I will support \\nthe DRC Government\\u2019s implementation of its anti-trafficking national action plan \\nand continue to urge action on the prioritized recommendations in the 2022 TIP Re-\\nport. \\nQuestion. How would you engage with the host government to reduce the recruit-\\nment and use of children in combat and other military related positions? \\nAnswer. Embassy Kinshasa has continually engaged with the DRC Government \\non the need to improve respect for human rights and explained the risks to our bi-\\nlateral relationship if unlawful recruitment and use of children is not addressed. At \\nthe same time the U.S. Government implements a variety of programs designed to \\nassist the DRC military on this path.

In addition PKO and IMET funding has sup-\\nported areas such as military justice civil-military relations human rights training \\nIHL training English language training military engineering and resource man-\\nagement and logistics for security forces in DRC. These efforts not only enhance se-\\ncurity provision but also helps make the security forces a more transparent ac-\\ncountable institution. Building on this successful cooperation the United States \\nsigned a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the DRC Government in Au-\\ngust 2020 to launch new cooperation in civil military operations (CMO) strategic \\ncommunications engineering and English language training. We are also working \\nwith the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) to revamp its human resources infra-\\nstructure which among other things would allow for enhanced accountability. \\nThese efforts have produced results. The number of prosecutions of both state and \\narmed group actors for crimes involving human rights violations and abuses includ-\\ning unlawful recruitment and use of children remains high as are the number of \\nchildren separated from armed groups. This past July the U.N. Secretary-General \\nin his annual report on children and armed conflict welcomed \\u2018\\u2018the commitment of \\nthe [DRC Government] to sustain the gains made in preventing child recruitment \\nand use including through screening mechanisms.\\u2019\\u2019 He also commended the DRC \\n\\u2018\\u2018for its efforts to hold perpetrators of grave violations accountable and urge them \\nto continue to do so including for cases of child recruitment and use and for cases \\nof sexual violence.\\u2019\\u2019 If confirmed I will leverage these tools and our close relation-\\nship with the DRC to aid its commitment to reduce the unlawful recruitment and \\nuse of children. \\nQuestion. In the State Department\\u2019s 2021 International Religious Freedom report \\nthe DRC remains a country of operation for ISIS attacking civilians in the North \\nKivu and Ituri provinces. U.S. officials have met with government authorities urg-\\ning security forces and political leaders to refrain from violence and respect the civil \\nrights of society. What actions would you take with the host government to build \\non previous U.S. engagement and promote religious freedom and tolerance? \\nAnswer. The United States and DRC are dedicated to the defeat of ISIS. In March \\n2021 the U.S. designated ISIS-DRC (also known as Allied Democratic Forces) as a \\nForeign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorist \\n(SDGT). The Allied Democratic Forces is designated under the U.N. 1533 DRC \\nSanctions Regime. In November 2021 Secretary Blinken also designated ISIS an \\nEntity of Particular Concern for the fifth consecutive year as a non-state actor that \\nhas engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom. The DRC joined \\nthe Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019 and is increasingly engaged with the \\nCoalition having participated in the 2022 D-ISIS Ministerial as well as the most \\nrecent Communication Working Group meeting held in Washington in July. \\nWith their influence on a wide range of civil and political issues including elec-\\ntions religious leaders throughout the DRC are close partners of our embassy in \\nKinshasa. Embassy Kinshasa has continually engaged with counterparts in Min-\\nistries of Human Rights Justice Defense and Interior to discuss issues of freedom \\nof religion or belief including government relations with religious organizations. \\nU.S. engagement prioritizes ensuring that the DRC Government respects human \\nrights including the rights to freedom of expression freedom of peaceful assembly \\nand to freedom of religion or belief. Ambassador Hammer met with religious leaders \\nfrequently and if confirmed I would continue these efforts to engage with govern-\\nment representatives and civil society groups to help ensure freedom of religion or \\nbelief for the people of the DRC. \\nQuestion. How could you work with security forces to increase pressure towards \\nremoval of ISIS operation within the country? \\nAnswer. Starting last November the Ugandan defense forces (UPDF) have been \\nconducting a military intervention in eastern DRC targeting ISIS-DRC named Op-\\neration Shuja. The Ugandans are conducting this mission with the DRC Govern-\\nment approval. MONUSCO is not mandated to work alongside the UPDF but we \\nhave constantly urged and tried to ensure operations are deconflicted with \\nMONUSCO and the Congolese armed forces (FARDC) and that all forces operating \\nin DRC respect human rights. \\nThe DRC joined the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in 2019 and is increasingly \\nengaged with the Coalition; having participated in the 2022 D-ISIS Ministerial as \\nwell as the most recent Communication Working Group meeting held in Washington \\nin July.

To \\nstrengthen DRC\\u2019s ability to prevent and respond to violent conflict I will if con-\\nfirmed continue to engage with the DRC Government on the need for security sec-\\ntor reform including respect for the rule of law and human rights and the imple-\\nmentation of a community-based national disarmament demobilization and re-\\nintegration program. \\nQuestion. The Office of Multilateral Strategy and Personnel (MSP) in the State \\nDepartment\\u2019s bureau of International Organizations is leading a whole-of-govern-\\nment effort to identify recruit and install qualified independent personnel at the \\nU.N. including in elections for specialized bodies like the International Tele-\\ncommunications Union (ITU). There is an American candidate Doreen Bogdan-Mar-\\ntin who if elected would be the first American and first woman to lead the ITU. \\nShe is in a tough race that will require early consistent engagement across capitals \\nand within the U.N. member states. If confirmed do you commit to demarching the \\nDRC and any other counterparts necessary to encourage their support of Ms. \\nBogdan-Martin? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how can you work with the International Organizations \\n(IO) bureau and other stakeholders to identify recruit and install qualified Ameri-\\ncans in positions like the Junior Program Officer (JPO) program at the U.N.? \\nAnswer. The Junior Professional Officer program is one of the key opportunities \\noffered by the U.N. to encourage young professionals interested in serving in inter-\\nnational organizations and it provides them with hands-on experience across var-\\nious U.N. agencies. The International Organization Affairs Bureau (IO) and the U.S. \\nMission to the U.N. (USUN) are well placed to ensure we have sufficient resources \\ntools and staffing to support more positions for American citizen JPOs in the U.N. \\nsystem. With these resources we can work strategically to increase the number of \\nJPO opportunities funded by the U.S. Government into key agencies and bodies that \\nwork on U.S. priorities expand our recruitment and outreach activities to ensure \\nthese opportunities are widely known and available to interested U.S. citizens and \\nprovide tools and services to strengthen our competitiveness in placing qualified \\nAmerican citizens into the U.N. system. If confirmed I will aid the efforts of IO and \\nUSUN from Kinshasa where possible. \\nQuestion. The DRC has a low rate of voting coincidence with the United States \\nin the U.N. General Assembly and in the Security Council. What is your assessment \\nof this issue? \\nAnswer. The U.S.-DRC relationship has strengthened significantly since the 2019 \\ninauguration of President Felix Tshisekedi. However a new DRC Permanent Rep-\\nresentative to the United Nations Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja was only just ap-\\npointed in January 2022 and I note that in 2022 the DRC supported resolutions \\nin U.N. bodies that called out Russia for its attack on Ukraine and aligned with \\nU.S. priorities at the United Nations. If confirmed I will work through the U.S. \\nMission to the United Nations and others in the Department of State to ensure U.S. \\nforeign policy objectives are shared and understood across Kinshasa Washington \\nand New York. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what concrete actions can you take to engage with the \\nCongolese on anticipated votes in the U.N. system that would increase their voting \\ncoincidence with the United States? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work through the U.S. Mission to the United Nations \\nand others in the Department of State to ensure U.S. foreign policy objectives are \\nshared and understood across Kinshasa Washington and New York.

With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry the CCP could \\nstop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose. \\n\\u2022 Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States? \\nAnswer. Certain activities by the People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Chinese \\nCommunist Party (CCP) represent a challenge to U.S. interests globally and in the \\nAfrica region. As Secretary Blinken said on May 26 we will invest align and com-\\npete with the PRC to defend our interests and build our vision for the future. \\nQuestion.

China has a large peacekeeping presence in the Democratic Republic of \\nthe Congo (DRC) where China Molybdenum a Chinese mining company has an 80 \\npercent stake in one of the world\\u2019s largest cobalt mines and the largest copper min-\\ning operation in the DRC. The DRC has given Chinese companies valuable conces-\\nsions to develop the rich critical mineral resources like cobalt in the country. Co-\\nbalt is critical to the U.S. information technology and defense industries. Beijing\\u2019s \\ninvolvement in the peacekeeping mission in the DRC and its heavy involvement in \\nthe DRC\\u2019s cobalt sector raises concerns that it is using its involvement in the peace-\\nkeeping system to protect its economic interests. The Trump Administration pushed \\nthe DRC Government to revisit these Chinese concessions. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed what will you do to convince the DRC to renegotiate or even re-\\nvoke mineral concessions given to Chinese companies? \\nAnswer. The United States supports the Government of the DRC\\u2019s decision to re-\\nview mining contracts and pursue greater accountability in the sector. In May 2021 \\nPresident Tshisekedi announced his intention to review Chinese mining deals with \\nunfavorable terms for the DRC. This is an ongoing process and the United States \\nhas informed the DRC Government of our support for its decision to review con-\\ntracts. Further economic development should promote democratic governance re-\\nspect for human rights and transparency. The United States is providing more than \\n$30 million in assistance to help the DRC promote responsible and sustainable min-\\ning practices and is actively looking at new engagements in the sector. As one exam-\\nple USAID\\u2019s new Constructing Competitive Responsible Minerals Trade project in \\nthe DRC provides trade and investment facilitation support with businesses that \\nsupport responsible transparent and conflict-free mining from the DRC. We sup-\\nport responsible minerals sourcing and trading and work closely with the private \\nsector to support conflict-free mineral supply chains. We created the Public-Private \\nAlliance for Responsible Minerals working with USAID and the Department of \\nLabor U.S. companies and civil society organizations to improve governance sys-\\ntems needed for ethical supply chains of conflict minerals in the DRC and Great \\nLakes region. \\nWe echo the long-standing calls from African capitals that PRC actions must re-\\nspect host country laws particularly regarding the human and labor rights the rule \\nof law and protections for the environment. We want to ensure U.S. companies can \\ncompete on an even playing field promoting entrepreneurship infrastructure devel-\\nopment energy access capacity-building and fair practices.

I understand that you served as Ambassador to the Central African Re-\\npublic (CAR) from January 2019 to January 2022. During this period the Govern-\\nment of the CAR essentially became a branch of Russia\\u2019s mercenary The Wagner \\nGroup. To this day the CAR Government is staffed with the associates and friends \\nof those Russian officials currently planning and managing Vladimir Putin\\u2019s war \\nagainst Ukraine. Valery Zakharov an FSB agent serves as a national security advi-\\nsor Russian Air Force General Oleg Polguev is an advisor to the Defense Minister \\nand another FSB agent Vladimir Tintorenko is an advisor to the Prime Minister. \\n\\u2022 During your tenure as Ambassador to CAR were you aware of growing Russian \\nentanglement with the CAR Government? \\nAnswer. Yes I was aware and I raised our concerns about the Wagner Group and \\nRussian presence with the highest levels of the Government. The United States \\nGovernment has severely limited its security assistance to the Government of CAR \\nin response to the CAR Government\\u2019s decision to continue collaborating with these \\nactors while we evaluate next steps. \\nQuestion. Did you advocate for U.S. policies that would encourage the CAR Gov-\\nernment to remove Wagner Group and Russian presence in CAR? Please elaborate. \\nAnswer. We raised our concerns about the Wagner Group and Russian presence \\nwith the highest levels of the Government and severely limited our security assist-\\nance to the Government of CAR in response to their decision to continue collabo-\\nrating with these actors while we evaluate next steps. We informed the CAR Gov-\\nernment that future assistance would be limited should they continue that relation-\\nship. We have encouraged the CAR Government to end impunity for violence and \\nseek partners that respect human rights. \\nQuestion. With regard to the DRC is the Chinese Communist Party making ef-\\nforts to increase its own influence within that government? \\nAnswer. The People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has extensive interests in the DRC. \\nThe DRC is now tied with the PRC as the third-biggest producer of copper in the \\nworld and the DRC produces approximately 70 percent of the world\\u2019s cobalt. Ex-\\nports of copper and cobalt provide 75 percent of the DRC\\u2019s export revenue and the \\nPRC is both the largest consumer of DRC-produced copper and cobalt and the DRC\\u2019s \\nlargest trading partner. If confirmed I will continue to engage with the DRC Gov-\\nernment to cement the United States as the DRC\\u2019s partner of choice. \\nQuestion. If confirmed as Ambassador to the DRC what will you do to ensure that \\nthe Chinese Communist Party does not establish the same level of influence there \\nas the Russian Wagner Group did in CAR under your watch? \\nAnswer. The People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist Par-\\nty\\u2019s (CCP) interest in the DRC is primarily economic. The PRC is the largest con-\\nsumer of DRC-produced cobalt and copper and the DRC\\u2019s largest trading partner. \\nThe United States has a long history of support for the DRC including over $20 \\nbillion in assistance much of which has gone to address health and humanitarian \\nemergencies. Socially responsible U.S. business practices compare favorably against \\nPRC business models. Congressionally mandated annual reporting such as the \\nHuman Rights Report the Findings of the Worst Forms of Child Labor and the \\nTrafficking in Persons Report shine a spotlight on exploitative business practices \\nand Executive Orders ensure that products made with forced labor and child labor \\ndo not reach U.S. markets.

LUCY TAMLYN BY SENATOR TODD YOUNG \\nQuestion. How do you view China\\u2019s diplomatic and economic engagement in the \\nDRC? \\nAnswer. The DRC\\u2019s economic resources make it an attractive destination for any \\nforeign investor including the People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). We do not seek to \\nlimit the DRC\\u2019s partnerships with other countries. We want the DRC to have op-\\ntions and to ensure it has the information it needs to make informed decisions. \\nIn this regard we echo the long-standing calls from African governments that PRC \\neconomic engagement should respect host country laws particularly those relating \\nto labor rights and environmental protections. We want the Congolese people to \\nknow that corrupt mineral exploitation deals illegal logging and environmental \\ndevastation is not inevitable. We also want to ensure that U.S. companies can com-\\npete on an even playing field. We believe the DRC benefits more from its partner-\\nship with the United States. The U.S. Government\\u2019s commitment to responsible \\nbusiness conduct shapes global standards that ensure that rights are respected \\naround the world. DRC officials tell us that they prefer investments by American \\nenterprises because they know a U.S. corporation will respect host country laws and \\nlabor rights and protect its workers. \\nQuestion. What is the host government\\u2019s main interest in engaging with China? \\nAnswer. The DRC is now tied with the PRC as the third-biggest producer of cop-\\nper in the world and the DRC produces approximately 70 percent of the world\\u2019s co-\\nbalt. Exports of copper and cobalt provide 75 percent of the DRC\\u2019s export revenue \\nand the PRC is both the largest consumer of DRC-produced copper and cobalt and \\nthe DRC\\u2019s largest trading partner. \\nQuestion.

I am deep-\\nly concerned that recent anti-MONUSCO protests have turned violent and included \\nattacks on MONUSCO facilities and resulted in peacekeeper and protester casual-\\nties. At the same time I was appalled by the July 31 shooting of civilians by peace-\\nkeepers in Kasindi and welcomed the Secretary-General\\u2019s swift response and strong \\nstatement calling for accountability. MONUSCO is by no means perfect but it is \\nan essential part of creating conditions for peace in eastern DRC. If confirmed I \\nlook forward to frequent interactions with MONUSCO leadership and close coordi-\\nnation with USUN as plans for the Mission\\u2019s transition move forward. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO RACHNA SACHDEVA KORHONEN BY SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you implement this 5-year strategy given there \\nwill be a military junta in place for nearly two of the five years? \\nAnswer. The interagency Sahel strategy seeks to build the political resolve of \\nSahel governments to regain public confidence at the national and local levels by \\nproviding the equitable delivery of government services law enforcement and jus-\\ntice. The Mali Integrated Country Strategy and USAID Country Development Coop-\\nerative Strategy are the baselines strategies for Mali and were informed by the \\nSahel Strategy. We can make progress on these goals during the transition period \\nas the transition government seeks also to make reforms that will strengthen the \\nfoundation of Mali\\u2019s democracy. We provided technical support to the electoral law \\npassed in June that creates a single electoral management body a best practice that \\nelection experts have called for repeatedly. We stand ready to assist the transition \\ngovernment as it moves towards a constitutional referendum and elections. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to updating me on the implementation of \\nthe strategy within 180 days of arriving at post? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit in coordination with the State Department\\u2019s Bu-\\nreau of Legislative Affairs to promptly accommodate requests for briefings and for \\ninformation by you and this Committee including on the implementation of the \\nstrategy. Our foreign policy is stronger when the two branches of government com-\\nmunicate and I would look forward to strengthening that communication \\nQuestion. Do you believe personal travel bans or other sanctions on military offi-\\ncers who seize power unconstitutionally or who engage in gross violations of human \\nrights are a useful tool? \\nAnswer. As I understand it our policy objective has been to work with the transi-\\ntion government to get Mali back on the path to democracy. We continually review \\nall tools available to us and determine what is the best tool to use to advance for-\\neign policy goals. Imposing visa restrictions or financial sanctions as a blanket re-\\nsponse to adverse political activity may be incongruent with the task of working \\nwith the transition government to undertake reforms that are demanded by their \\npeople to form the foundation of a more responsive democratic system. My under-\\nstanding is that following the May 2021 military takeover we cut security assist-\\nance programs valued at $9.1 million that had continued under available authori-\\nties. Ending security assistance which the Mali coup leaders monitor closely as \\nmilitary officers had a more significant impact. When we have credible information \\nthat a foreign official has been involved in a gross violation of human rights we \\nare required by law to designate that individual under Section 7031(c).

If confirmed do you commit to reviewing the approach we have taking \\nand sending to me in writing your assessment of how such sanctions could usefully \\nbe applied within 90 days of arriving at post? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to reviewing the approach we have taken and \\nsending to you in writing my assessment of how such visa restrictions or financial \\nsanctions could usefully be applied within 90 days of arriving at Post. I also commit \\nto continuously assessing whether visa restrictions or financial sanctions should be \\nimposed during my Ambassadorship if confirmed. \\nQuestion. What are the most important actions you have taken in your career to \\ndate to support democracy and human rights? What has been the impact of your \\nactions? \\nAnswer. During my time in Sri Lanka we encouraged the newly elected govern-\\nment to include all factions in the Government but to also provide accountability \\nfor wartime abuses. We achieved some successes on both counts but it was slow \\nand cumbersome requiring a lot of effort from multiple parts of the US Government. \\nOur biggest success was to encourage the Sri Lankan Parliament to work together \\nwith Congress on training and exchanges a partnership that exists until today that \\nis codified in a USAID project lasting multiple years. During my time in Kirkuk \\nIraq I was able to convince the Turkmen faction to stand in local elections after \\nthey threatened to boycott. Their participation in the elections resulted in elections \\nthat were accepted by all parties and that laid the foundation for governance and \\ndemocracy in Kirkuk. \\nQuestion. What issues are the most pressing challenges to democracy or demo-\\ncratic development in the Republic of Mali? These challenges might include obsta-\\ncles to participatory and accountable governance and institutions rule of law au-\\nthentic political competition civil society human rights and press freedom. Please \\nbe as specific as possible. \\nAnswer. There are many challenges to democracy and democratic development in \\nMali. Mali has suffered three military seizures of power in the past ten years. Weak \\ngovernance a severe security crisis poor development and acute food insecurity are \\nsome of the many difficulties of life in Mali. The failure of government to address \\nthese problems has led to a loss of faith by many Malians in their government and \\nin democracy. This frustration is particularly apparent in the north where the mi-\\nnority populations have long felt ignored by Bamako. Additionally corruption is \\nrampant though during the transition we have not seen the same high-level corrup-\\ntion as in previous regimes. Political parties are numerous but often do not think \\nbeyond the special interests of Bamako. The arrival of the Kremlin-backed Wagner \\nGroup was accompanied by a spike in pro-Wagner and pro-Russian sentiments \\nacross social media as well as disinformation linked to Wagner financier Yevgeniy \\nPrigozhin that has muddied the media environment. Warnings by the transition \\ngovernment to support the Malian Armed Forces reportedly led to self-censorship \\nby the press. Some critics of the transition government have been arrested. Women \\ncontinue to play a secondary role in Malian society and the transition government \\nhas fallen short of meeting the law that requires thirty percent of elected or ap-\\npointed officials to be women. Finally the transition government\\u2019s plan to tackle se-\\ncurity does not extend to addressing root drivers of conflict and as evidenced by al-\\nlegations of human rights abuses and violations will increase the distrust Mali\\u2019s \\npeople feel toward their government. \\nQuestion. What steps will you take\\u2014if confirmed\\u2014to support democracy in the \\nRepublic of Mali? What do you hope to accomplish through these actions? What are \\nthe potential impediments to addressing the specific obstacles you have identified? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will assist the transition government as it moves towards \\na constitutional referendum and elections building on the partnership established \\nwhen the United States provided technical assistance in support of the creation of \\nthe recent electoral law. I will support programs aimed at bolstering the capacity \\nof civil society and the media as well as programs to counter disinformation. I will \\namplify the voices of women who are working to make a difference in their commu-\\nnities and for their country. Through these actions I hope to work with Malians \\nto set them on a path to responsive democratic governance that will lead to a more \\nstable Mali. \\nMali\\u2019s return to democracy and the reforms necessary to create a strong founda-\\ntion for that democracy are ultimately in the hands of the transition government. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00076\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n77 \\nWe cannot want it more than they do.

How will you utilize U.S. Government assistance resources at your dis-\\nposal including the Democracy Commission Small Grants program and other \\nsources of State Department and USAID funding to support democracy and govern-\\nance and what will you prioritize in processes to administer such assistance? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will utilize all available U.S. foreign assistance programs \\nand tools to strengthen democracy and good governance in Mali. State Department \\nand USAID resources are critical to achieving our policy goals and advancing our \\nvalues in Mali. I will prioritize available assistance necessary to restore democratic \\ngovernance in Mali. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to meet with civil society members human \\nrights and other non-governmental organizations in the U.S. and with local human \\nrights NGOs and other members of civil society in the Republic of Mali? What steps \\nwill you take to pro-actively address efforts to restrict or penalize NGOs and civil \\nsociety via legal or regulatory measures? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to meeting with civil society members human \\nrights and other non-government organizations in the United States and with local \\nhuman rights NGOs and other members of civil society in Mali. I understand the \\nEmbassy conducts such engagements regularly and I plan to build on their good \\nwork. I will advocate for unimpeded operation by NGOs and civil society who do \\nmuch to address root drivers of instability both with the transition government and \\npublicly should it be deemed helpful. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to meet with democratically oriented polit-\\nical opposition figures and parties? What steps will you take to encourage genuine \\npolitical competition? Will you advocate for access and inclusivity for women mi-\\nnorities and youth within political parties? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to meet with democratically oriented political op-\\nposition figures and parties. I will encourage political figures and parties to consider \\nthe equities of all Malians not just those in Bamako and to run on platforms built \\non substance not personality. I will advocate with the transition government for op-\\nposition figures to be able to participate fully in the political process as Mali holds \\nlegislative elections a constitutional referendum and presidential elections by \\nMarch 2024. I will advocate with the transition government for opposition figures \\nto be able to speak freely without fear of reprisal. I will advocate for press freedom \\nso that disinformation does not interfere in political debates and dialogues. I will \\nadvocate for access and inclusivity for women members of minority groups and \\nyouth within political parties. I will urge the transition government to meet any re-\\nlated requirements under national law such as the 30 percent appointment of \\nwomen in the Cabinet and the National Transition Council. I will press for the expe-\\nditious implementation of the Algiers Accord so Mali\\u2019s democracy more fully rep-\\nresents its northern citizens. \\nQuestion. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with the Republic of \\nMali on freedom of the press and address any government efforts designed to control \\nor undermine press freedom through legal regulatory or other measures? Will you \\ncommit to meeting regularly with independent local press in the Republic of Mali? \\nAnswer. I am very concerned about the decrease in press freedom and the rise \\nof disinformation that has accompanied the arrival of the Kremlin-backed Wagner \\nGroup. If confirmed I plan to prioritize addressing and countering disinformation. \\nA well-informed citizenry is required for a functioning democracy so I support the \\ncontinuation of current embassy and Department programs to educate and train \\njournalists about the dangers of disinformation and procedures to publicly refute \\ndangerous disinformation such as fact-checking. I will commit to meeting regularly \\nwith local press in Mali and extolling the dangers of disinformation and promoting \\nthe benefits of a free press. \\nQuestion. Will you and your embassy team actively engage with civil society and \\ngovernment counterparts on countering disinformation and propaganda dissemi-\\nnated by foreign state or non-state actors in the country? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will prioritize building on the embassy team\\u2019s ongoing \\nwork and programs to counter disinformation and propaganda perpetuated by for-\\neign and non-state actors. I will also build on the close relationship created between \\nthe embassy team and the Department\\u2019s Global Engagement Center (GEC) as they \\nprioritize exposing and countering state-sponsored disinformation.

I will en-\\ngage the transition government on the destabilizing effects of disinformation and \\nthe need to protect press freedom. \\nQuestion. Will you and your embassy teams actively engage with the Republic of \\nMali on the right of labor groups to organize including for independent trade \\nunions? \\nAnswer. Labor unions are an important and influential part of Mali\\u2019s society and \\nthe International Trade Union Confederation has noted the significant efforts of \\nlabor unions to strengthen social dialogue and progress on climate change social \\nprotection universal health insurance decent work migration and education. Mali \\ncontinues to face significant challenges on labor as almost 90 percent of workers are \\nin the informal economy about 12 percent of children are engaging in child labor \\nand women still do the lion\\u2019s share of unpaid care and domestic work including \\nsome forms of descent-based slavery. I will engage the transition government on the \\nright of workers to organize including to form independent trade unions and en-\\ncourage legal remedies for labor abuses. \\nQuestion. Will you commit to using your position if confirmed to defend the \\nhuman rights and dignity of all people in the Republic of Mali no matter their sex-\\nual orientation or gender identity? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will use my position to promote respect for the human \\nrights and dignity of all in Mali no matter their sexual orientation or gender iden-\\ntity. A hallmark of Mali\\u2019s society is its diversity. A country that unites across its \\ndifferences will always be stronger and more resilient. \\nQuestion. What challenges do the lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer \\n(LGBTQ) people face in the Republic of Mali? \\nAnswer. LGBTQI+ individuals in Mali experience physical psychological and \\ngender-based violence with some individuals subjected to \\u2018\\u2018corrective\\u2019\\u2019 punishment. \\nPolice frequently refuse to intervene when such violence has occurred. As the transi-\\ntion government considers members of the LGBTQI+ community to be \\u2018\\u2018immoral\\u2019\\u2019 \\npromoting respect for freedom of association remains difficult. The law prohibits \\nconduct pertaining to \\u2018\\u2018attacks on morality\\u2019\\u2019 thereby criminalizing on a de facto \\nbasis consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults as well as non-sexual as-\\nsociation. The transition government actively enforces this law. Most LGBTQI+ indi-\\nviduals in Mali isolate themselves and keep their sexual orientation or gender iden-\\ntity hidden. LGBTQI+ individuals frequently drop out of school leave their places \\nof employment and do not seek medical treatment in order to hide their sexual \\nidentity and avoid social stigmatization. \\nQuestion. What specifically will you commit to do to help LGBTQ people in the \\nRepublic of Mali? \\nAnswer. As Secretary Blinken has said promoting and advancing respect for the \\nhuman rights of LGBTQI+ persons is a foreign policy priority for this Administra-\\ntion. If confirmed I will advocate for the human rights and dignity of all in Mali \\nincluding LGBTQI+ persons. In the spirit of \\u2018\\u2018do no harm\\u2019\\u2019 I will meet with \\nLGBTQI+ civil society members and seek their advice on how the U.S. Embassy can \\nbest support them. \\nQuestion. Will you commit if confirmed to ensuring that you fully brief Members \\nof Congress and/or their staff each time you are in Washington for visits or consulta-\\ntions during your tenure as Ambassador to the Republic of Mali? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit in coordination with the State Department\\u2019s Bu-\\nreau of Legislative Affairs to promptly accommodate requests for briefings and for \\ninformation by this Committee. Our foreign policy is stronger when the two \\nbranches of government communicate and I would look forward to strengthening \\nthat communication. \\nQuestion.

Throughout my \\nState Department career I have valued and encouraged a diverse and inclusive \\nwork environment and if confirmed I intend to bring that same spirit to Embassy \\nBamako by supporting post\\u2019s inclusive hiring and selection procedures. \\nQuestion. What specifically will you do to prioritize and promote diversity equity \\ninclusion and accessibility while also combating racism discrimination and in-\\nequality among locally employed staff in the Republic of Mali? \\nAnswer. I will hold all of our staff at Embassy Bamako to the same standard. \\nMali is a country rich and diverse in culture and Embassy Bamako reflects that di-\\nversity. If confirmed I intend to ensure that all employees working in Embassy \\nBamako whether they are locally employed staff eligible family members or U.S. \\ndirect hires feel supported and heard in their work. I maintain an open office policy \\nand welcome the contributions and ideas of those working in our mission. \\nQuestion. In addition to focusing on diversity equity inclusion and accessibility \\nin our workforce will you commit to engaging more equitably in operations and pro-\\ngramming particularly with potential partners and communities that traditionally \\nhave been marginalized excluded or underrepresented in ours and others\\u2019 donor \\npartnership efforts? How do you anticipate utilizing local expertise knowledge and \\ncapacity to meet our foreign policy goals? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I commit to engaging with partners and communities that \\nhave been traditionally marginalized underrepresented or excluded in donor or \\npartnership efforts. Learning from local expertise and knowledge is critical to build-\\ning successful programs and foreign policy goals. \\nEmbassy Bamako has a truly diverse workforce from all parts of Mali and I hope \\nwe can leverage that for our strategic goals for democracy governance and services \\nfor all. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO RACHNA SACHDEVA KORHONEN BY SENATOR JAMES E. RISCH \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you engage the current Government in Mali on \\nthe issue of return to constitutional democratic rule? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to stand firmly with the Malian people in \\ntheir aspirations for democracy peace development and respect for human rights. \\nI will press the transition government to keep its promise to return the country to \\nthe Malian people through democratic governance. The reforms the transition gov-\\nernment has committed to undertake such as constitutional reform will build a \\nfoundation for a stronger more responsive democracy in Mali and if confirmed I \\nwill encourage the transition government to undertake these reforms expeditiously. \\nI will also caution them that some reforms are the work of generations and will \\nneed to be handed over to a democratically-elected government. I echo Ambassador \\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield\\u2019s observation \\u2018\\u2018that a Mali isolated from its community of \\nnations and ECOWAS is not where Mali wants to be.\\u2019\\u2019 I share her wish to work with \\nthe Malian transition government to bring Mali back into the community of nations \\nwhere it belongs. In order to rebuild relationships with its neighbors the transition \\ngovernment first needs to demonstrate commitment to the transition timelines and \\nto work transparently with ECOWAS special envoy Goodluck Jonathan and the \\ntransition monitoring committee. If confirmed I will seek to assist the transition \\ngovernment as it moves towards the constitutional referendum and elections but we \\nmust see progress. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you engage the current Government in Mali on \\nthe issue of implementing what is salvageable of the Algiers Accord? \\nAnswer. Full implementation of the Algiers Accord remains the best path to peace \\nin northern Mali. The Accord itself addresses key grievances of northern populations \\nand calls for important steps towards decentralization of power security sector re-\\nform development and reconciliation. These priorities are now applicable to other \\nareas of the country suffering from instability.

If confirmed I will underscore this fact to the transition \\ngovernment and urge full implementation of the Accord. The recent meeting among \\nthe signatory parties and the transition government\\u2019s pledge to incorporate 26000 \\nex-fighters into the Malian Armed Forces are positive steps. I will also stress that \\nno level of international involvement can secure peace for Mali. The signatory par-\\nties themselves must be driving the effort to bring peace throughout Mali. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you engage the current Government in Mali on \\nthe presence of the Russian-affiliated Wagner Group in Mali as a security alter-\\nnative following the departure of French Operation Barkhane? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to highlight the harmful effects of the Wag-\\nner Group including the rise in allegations of human rights violations and abuses \\nemanating from the campaigns of the Malian Armed Forces alongside the Wagner \\nGroup. I will stress that these allegations will put the resumption of U.S. security \\nassistance in doubt after a democratically-elected government has taken office in \\nMali. I will address the limitations placed on the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated \\nStabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) due to the Wagner Group and note how \\nthe Malian people are not receiving the full benefit of MINUSMA\\u2019s efforts due to \\nthose restrictions. I will illuminate how Yevgeniy Prigozhin\\u2019s disinformation net-\\nwork is harming Mali\\u2019s media space threatening peacekeeper safety and manipu-\\nlating the Malian people. I will underscore that Prigozhin\\u2019s extractive partnerships \\nwill leave Mali poorer as it gives away resources that could be invested into the Ma-\\nlian Armed Forces and other government efforts aimed to tackle root drivers of in-\\nstability. \\nQuestion. What is your view of the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in Mali \\nMINUSMA the deadliest peacekeeping mission in the world particularly given the \\npost-coup environment in Mali? \\nAnswer. The United States strongly supports MINUSMA as the leading compo-\\nnent of the international community\\u2019s efforts to address the political and security \\ncrises in Mali including by supporting the parties to make progress towards sus-\\ntainable peace. MINUSMA also plays a critical role in the protection of Malian civil-\\nians and facilitating their access to basic services as well as humanitarian aid. The \\nrestrictions the transition government has imposed on MINUSMA as well as the \\narrival of the Wagner Group threaten the safety of MINUSMA peacekeepers and \\nobstruct the implementation of the mission\\u2019s mandate. \\nQuestion. As U.S. Ambassador if confirmed how will you engage MINUSMA lead-\\nership to ensure that mandate of the mission is appropriate for the existing political \\nand security environment in Mali? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will engage regularly with MINUSMA leadership to deter-\\nmine how the United States can best support the mission\\u2019s efforts to carry out its \\nmandate including through advocating with the transition government to ensure \\nMINUSMA\\u2019s freedom of movement. I will encourage transparent and timely human \\nrights reporting performance reporting and reporting on the restrictions placed on \\nMINUSMA as well as host nation Status of Forces Agreement violations. I will work \\nwith colleagues in Washington to ensure that MINSUMA\\u2019s mandate and resources \\nare aligned with the current realities and challenges on the ground. \\nQuestion. As U.S. Ambassador if confirmed how will you engage with leadership \\nin the Africa Bureau at the State Department to ensure the mandate of MINUSMA \\nis appropriate for the existing political and security environment in Mali? \\nAnswer.

Do you commit to being consistently engaged with interlocutors in Mali \\nas well as with the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs on \\nU.S. efforts to secure the release of U.S. citizen hostages Jeffery Woodke and Sister \\nTennyson? \\nAnswer. I am already acquainted with Special Presidential Envoy Carstens and \\nhis staff and while we could not discuss the cases I expressed my commitment to \\ncoordinate with him and other stakeholders consistently regarding efforts to secure \\nthe release of U.S. citizen hostages. The Department of State has no greater respon-\\nsibility than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. If confirmed I commit \\nto raising this important issue consistently with interlocuters in Mali. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you engage with the host government on anti- \\ntrafficking work? Please describe these efforts in detail. \\nQuestion. If confirmed I will stress the importance of tackling human trafficking \\nand related issues with the transition government which faces an automatic down-\\ngrade to Tier 3 next year. I will advocate for the National Transition Council to \\namend the 2012 anti-trafficking law to ensure that it can be used to effectively in-\\nvestigate and prosecute trafficking offenses involving hereditary slavery and sen-\\ntence convicted slaveholders to significant prison terms. Additionally Mali continues \\nto struggle with recruitment and use of children by non-state armed groups sup-\\nported by the transition government. These groups have signed action plans with \\nthe United Nations and I will vigorously advocate for their full implementation and \\nthe cessation of all unlawful recruitment and use of children. \\nQuestion.

I will highlight the allegations of human rights abuses \\nand violations committed by the Malian Armed Forces in cooperation with the \\nKremlin-backed Wagner Group which are counterproductive to a viable counterter-\\nrorism operation that should seek to protect civilians. \\nQuestion. Do you commit to raising these issues directly? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I am committed to raising credible reports of human rights \\nabuses and violations directly to the highest levels of the transition government to \\nincrease accountability for those responsible. \\nQuestion. What is your understanding of morale throughout Mission Bamako? \\nAnswer. I understand morale at Embassy Bamako is high despite a challenging \\nliving and working environment. The challenges have pulled the team closer and \\nonly enhanced interagency cooperation. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve morale at Mission Bamako? \\nAnswer. The wellbeing of our people is paramount. If confirmed I will make \\nmaintaining morale of utmost importance. I will work closely with my staff under-\\nstand their concerns about morale and communicate those concerns back to Depart-\\nment leadership. In my experience the best work comes from well-resourced teams \\nthat support one another in their work towards achieving common goals and ad-\\nvancing U.S. policies. If confirmed I will maintain clear communication and articu-\\nlate goals and priorities early on and often. I will work across the interagency and \\nwith Washington to ensure that future growth meets U.S. strategic objectives and \\ncan be supported effectively by post\\u2019s management platform. \\nQuestion.

I maintain an open office policy and welcome the contributions and \\nideas of those working in our mission. I will also actively support Embassy \\nBamako\\u2019s existing mentorship programs for first and second tour officers mid-level \\nU.S. direct hires and our Locally Employed Staff and ensure that they meet the \\nprofessional development needs of staff. \\nQuestion. How would you describe your management style? \\nAnswer. My management style is to lead from behind. To let the experts do their \\nwork while providing enough guidance so that there are no misunderstandings. I \\nlike to collaborate and make sure I provide everything in my power so that my team \\ncan get the job done. I am a positive person and I like to find the best in everyone. \\nI like to coach not coerce. I am also empathetic in my approach to leading teams. \\nIf confirmed I will prioritize collaboration and partnerships including from Con-\\ngressional representatives to achieve U.S. policy priorities in Mali. I am willing to \\ngive my time and myself to better my team. My management principles are as fol-\\nlows: \\n\\u2022 Act like a leader\\u2014Take action and glean insights on the results of those efforts. \\nShare everything seen and heard with teammates. \\n\\u2022 Regulate yourself\\u2014EQ is twice as important as technical skills and IQ in driv-\\ning performance and achieving success. Control emotional outbursts and redirect \\nthem in more productive ways \\n\\u2022 Become self-aware\\u2014Ask for feedback from colleagues. Effective team perform-\\nance begins with how the leader sees the situation. \\n\\u2022 Be persuasive\\u2014Establish credibility through expertise and relationships. Rein-\\nforce your position with numerical data and stories. Connect emotionally with \\nyour audience. \\n\\u2022 Coach the team you have not the team you want. Most of us will not have the \\nluxury of inheriting our \\u2018\\u2018dream team\\u2019\\u2019. We can encourage and bring out the best \\ntraits of our team members and find that rewarding in itself. \\n\\u2022 Surround yourself with people that fill your gaps. You want a team that com-\\nplements you. Lack of diversity on a team can create an echo chamber that \\nkeeps you from being aware of crucial issues impacting your business. \\nQuestion. Do you believe it is ever acceptable or constructive to berate subordi-\\nnates either in public or private? \\nAnswer. No I do not. \\nQuestion. How do you envision your leadership relationship with your deputy \\nchief of mission? \\nAnswer. I hope to have a wonderful and honest partnership with my deputy chief \\nof mission. We will work as a true team to ensure the U.S. Mission in Mali is best \\nplaced to advance U.S. interests. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what leadership responsibilities do you intend to entrust \\nto your deputy chief of mission? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will entrust my DCM with the responsibilities akin to \\nthose of a chief operating officer. While both the DCM and I will have responsibility \\nfor coaching and mentoring the Embassy team if confirmed I will also ask the \\nDCM to play the primary role in ensuring the career development of the first- and \\nsecond-tour officers on the Embassy team. And I will be open to any ideas that the \\nDCM has about functions in which s/he is particularly interested or where s/he has \\nparticular strengths. \\nQuestion. Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate \\nconstructive feedback on their performances in order to encourage improvement and \\nreward those who most succeeded in their roles? \\nAnswer. Yes I do. \\nQuestion. If confirmed would you support and encourage clear accurate and di-\\nrect feedback to employees in order to improve performance and reward high achiev-\\ners? \\nAnswer. Yes I will. \\nQuestion.

Restrictions on movement due to the security environment have made \\noutside meetings challenging but I understand diplomats at Embassy Bamako are \\nstill able to regularly meet contacts and provide robust well-informed reporting to \\nthe Department. If confirmed I will listen to my team to understand what resources \\nthey need to increase in-person interactions. outside Embassy walls. There must be \\na balance between mission security concerns and COVID\\u201319 mitigation. I see great \\nvalue in leaving the embassy compound and am committed to ensuring the safety \\nof my teammates. If in-person interactions are unsafe I will provide technological \\nsupport to my team so that they are still able to fully accomplish our mission. \\nQuestion. How do you intend to improve the ability of U.S. diplomats to better \\naccess all local populations? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will listen to my team to understand what resources they \\nneed from the State Department to increase in-person interactions. If in-person \\ninteractions are unsafe I will provide technological support to my team so that they \\nare able to meet virtually with their contacts. \\nQuestion. What is the public diplomacy environment like in Mali? \\nAnswer. The United States is very visible in all areas of public diplomacy in Mali: \\ntraditional media social media education and cultural programs. The U.S. Em-\\nbassy has strong relationships with media professionals in both state-owned and \\nprivate media including through the offering of trainings and exchange opportuni-\\nties. Voice of America\\u2019s Bambara-language service is a popular and trusted source \\nof information for many Malians. As for social media the U.S. Embassy\\u2019s Facebook \\npage is one of the most followed official pages in the country. Over the past year \\nMalian social media has become thoroughly infested with disinformation much of \\nit anti-Western and/or pro-Russian. Kremlin-linked proxies exploit instability to \\ngain influence particularly through disinformation and the deployment of the Wag-\\nner Group forces. The onslaught of disinformation has made some parts of the Ma-\\nlian public more skeptical about U.S. policies but many Malians are still very posi-\\ntively disposed towards the United States. The demand for U.S. help in promoting \\nthe teaching and use of English in schools the media and the business environment \\nis insatiable especially as Malians are seeking to diversify partnerships away from \\nreliance on France. The network of exchange alumni especially those of the Young \\nAfrican Leaders Initiative (YALI) Mandela Washington Fellowship are force multi-\\npliers for the United States. The demand for spaces in U.S. exchange programs is \\nmagnitudes beyond the spaces available. \\nQuestion. What public diplomacy challenges do U.S. diplomats face there? \\nAnswer. The deteriorating security environment creates the most challenging ob-\\nstacles to U.S. public diplomacy. Most public diplomacy work outside of Bamako re-\\nlies on implementation through grant partners. Virtual programs to reach audiences \\noutside the capital are hampered by poor internet quality and expensive internet. \\nGiven the burgeoning youth population (one of the youngest populations in the \\nworld) the number of positions in youth exchange programs cannot come close to \\nmeeting demand. The proliferation of disinformation has transformed the informa-\\ntion landscape in ways unfavorable to U.S. interests. Not only has the Prigozhin en-\\nterprise deployed considerable resources to turn public opinion against France Eu-\\nrope and MINUSMA but many Malians have enthusiastically taken to creating \\nhomegrown disinformation. A network of self-proclaimed \\u2018\\u2018pan-Africanists\\u2019\\u2019 some of \\nwhom with confirmed links to the Kremlin from across Africa have taken up the \\nanti-French pro-Russian cause and have turned Mali into a testing ground for \\nspreading this contagion to neighboring countries. WhatsApp has become the most \\nefficient\\u2014and most difficult to track\\u2014vector for spreading narratives inimical to \\nU.S. interests. Facebook is widely used to propagate disinformation. TikTok is be-\\ncoming a new tool for reaching youth with hostile content. The U.S. diplomats based \\nin Bamako do not have the tools staffing and resources to counter this coordinated \\ninformation operation. Rising influence of the People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is \\nalso an issue to watch. While the PRC\\u2019s presence is most obvious in the economic \\nsphere the PRC is also growing in influence in the public diplomacy space. For ex-\\nample the Confucius Institute at the largest public university is well-resourced and \\nvery popular with students. The PRC has also played a large role in financing and \\nconstructing the new public university campus on the outskirts of Bamako while \\nthe United States just this year opened a modest American Corner on that same \\ncampus. \\nQuestion. How do you balance the importance of Main State versus the in-country \\nmission when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy messages for foreign audiences? \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00083\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n84 \\nAnswer. I believe both Main State and our mission in Bamako have important \\nroles to play when it comes to tailoring public diplomacy messages for foreign audi-\\nences. Public diplomacy officials on the ground can use close relationships with local \\nmedia to reach a broad array of Malians with our messaging. Officials in Wash-\\nington\\u2014with a wider audience\\u2014offer a platform to amplify this messaging. If con-\\nfirmed I will ensure our mission and Main State coordinate on messaging to ensure \\nit is as effective as possible. \\nQuestion. \\u2018\\u2018Anomalous health incidents\\u2019\\u2019 commonly referred to as \\u2018\\u2018Havana Syn-\\ndrome\\u2019\\u2019 have been debilitating and sidelining U.S. diplomats around the world for \\nyears. They have caused serious negative consequences for U.S. diplomacy yet \\nmany believe that the Department is not doing enough to care for protect and com-\\nmunicate to its personnel. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed do you commit to taking this threat seriously? \\nAnswer. Yes. I am deeply troubled by potential anomalous health incidents that \\nhave affected U.S. Government personnel and their family members. Serving one\\u2019s \\ncountry overseas should not come at the cost of one\\u2019s health. I agree that such inci-\\ndents may pose a threat to the well-being of U.S. personnel and must be taken ex-\\ntremely seriously. If confirmed the health safety and security of Embassy staff \\ntheir family members and all those supporting the mission will be my highest pri-\\nority. \\nQuestion. If confirmed do you commit to talking as openly as you can to Mission \\nBamako personnel? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I am committed to regularly share new information on this \\nissue consistent with ensuring the integrity of ongoing investigations. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO RACHNA SACHDEVA KORHONEN BY SENATOR TODD YOUNG \\nQuestion. If confirmed how would you encourage the transition government to ad-\\nhere to its agreement with ECOWAS for a 24-month political transition? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to stand firmly with the Malian people in \\ntheir aspirations for democracy peace development and respect for human rights. \\nI will press the transition government to keep its promise to return the country to \\nthe Malian people through democratic governance. The reforms the transition gov-\\nernment seeks to undertake such as constitutional reform will build a foundation \\nfor a stronger more responsive democracy in Mali and if confirmed I will encour-\\nage the transition government to undertake these reforms expeditiously. I will also \\ncaution them that some reforms are the work of generations and will need to be \\nhanded over to a democratic government. I echo Ambassador Linda Thomas-Green-\\nfield\\u2019s observation \\u2018\\u2018that a Mali isolated from its community of nations and \\nECOWAS is not where Mali wants to be.\\u2019\\u2019 I share her wish to work with the Malian \\ntransition government to bring Mali back into the community of nations where it \\nbelongs. In order to rebuild relationships with its neighbors the transition govern-\\nment first needs to demonstrate commitment to the transition timelines and work \\ntransparently with ECOWAS special envoy Goodluck Jonathan and the transition \\nmonitoring committee. If confirmed I will seek to assist the transition government \\nas it moves towards the constitutional referendum and elections but we must see \\nprogress. \\nQuestion. To what degree do you assess that U.S. adversaries and their actors \\nsuch as the Wagner Group successfully operate in Mali? \\nAnswer. Russia enjoys a burgeoning relationship with the transition government \\nevidenced by numerous ministerial trips by transition government members to Rus-\\nsia in recent months. The Wagner Group through its partnership with the Malian \\nArmed Forces (FAMa) is participating in operations in the country. Ultimately \\n1000 Wagner forces will not achieve what 5000 French forces could not. The tactics \\nWagner has allegedly used in Moura and elsewhere have resulted in a spike in \\nhuman rights abuses. Wagner will not bring peace to Mali. \\nQuestion. Beyond support for international peacekeeping operations what specifi-\\ncally would you do as Chief of Mission to discourage the Malian Government from \\nrelying on the aid of our adversaries\\u2014whether military or economic? \\nAnswer.

Countries that partner \\nwith Prigozhin and Wagner become weaker poorer more volatile and less secure. \\nAs a practical matter leaders in such countries lose control of security operations \\nwithin their territory. The steep costs in payments and mineral concessions that are \\ndemanded by Prigozhin\\u2019s enterprises deprive national budgets and local citizens of \\ncritically needed resources. Prigozhin is best known for financing the Internet Re-\\nsearch Agency (IRA) an entity that repeatedly attempted to interfere in the U.S. \\nelections. Through companies that exploit Africa\\u2019s natural resources political \\noperatives who undermine democratic actors front companies posing as NGOs and \\nsocial media manipulation Prigozhin spreads disinformation to influence African \\npolitics in the Kremlin\\u2019s favor. The Wagner Group\\u2019s alleged human rights abuses \\nincluding at Moura and Gossi will only harm the transition government counterter-\\nrorism efforts by alienated the Malian people. \\nIf confirmed I will call on the transition government to take action to facilitate \\nresponsible and accountable security assistance efforts aimed at protecting and em-\\npowering the Malian people. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you work as Chief of Mission to ensure continuing \\nsupport of PEPFAR and other life-saving health programs? \\nAnswer. USAID has partnered with the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs \\ncivil society and private sector for over 60 years and remains Mali\\u2019s largest bilat-\\neral health donor. Our health programs reach 80 percent of Malians. USAID\\u2019s \\nhealth programs focus on strengthening communities\\u2019 capacity to protect their own \\nhealth and strengthen the health systems that underpin successful expansion of ac-\\ncess to and use of high impact primary health care services in the areas of maternal \\nand child health voluntary family planning and disease prevention and control. I \\nview these health initiatives including PEPFAR as vital to our efforts to promote \\na more stable peaceful and resilient Mali. If confirmed I will endeavor to ensure \\nthese programs are supported so we can continue this critical work. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO RACHNA SACHDEVA KORHONEN BY SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS \\nQuestion. What is your view of the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in Mali \\nMINUSMA the deadliest peacekeeping mission in the world particularly given the \\npost-coup environment in Mali? As U.S. Ambassador if confirmed how will you en-\\ngage MINUSMA leadership and leadership in the Africa and International Organi-\\nzation Affairs Bureaus at the State Department to make sure that mandate of the \\nmission is appropriate for the existing political and security environment in Mali \\nAnswer. The United States strongly supports MINUSMA as the leading compo-\\nnent of the international community\\u2019s efforts to address the political and security \\ncrises in Mali including by supporting the parties to make progress towards sus-\\ntainable peace. MINUSMA also plays a critical role in the protection of Malian civil-\\nians and facilitating their access to basic services as well as humanitarian aid. \\nThe restrictions the transition government has imposed on MINUSMA as well as \\nthe arrival of the Wagner Group threaten the safety of MINUSMA peacekeepers \\nand obstruct the implementation of the mission\\u2019s mandate. The United States has \\nurged the transition government to enable MINUSMA to carry out its mandate \\nunimpeded. If confirmed I will continue to advocate for MINUSMA in this regard. \\nIf confirmed I commit to continuing the sustained senior-level engagement Em-\\nbassy Bamako conducts with MINUSMA both on the Force and Civilian sides. I will \\nalso continue to advocate with the transition government for MINUSMA to be able \\nto carry out its mandate unimpeded. I will provide colleagues in the Bureaus of Afri-\\ncan and International Organization Affairs with the on-the-ground perspective nec-\\nessary for the Department to assess the mission\\u2019s effectiveness and inform the inter-\\nagency policy process. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO ROLFE MICHAEL SCHIFFER BY SENATOR EDWARD J.

I have closely followed the Philippines for many years and am very famil-\\niar with the environmental and land defenders that you raise. I deeply admire their \\nbrave efforts in the face of very real danger in the Philippines. Their efforts are even \\nmore urgent in the face of the climate crisis which impacts the Philippines in pro-\\nfound and numerous ways. \\nIf confirmed I will work to ensure that all relevant USAID staff give this issue \\nthe urgent attention that it deserves. I will make sure our staff are aware of and \\nable to connect defenders and supporting organizations to available resources in \\neach country including those that may be supported by the USG and other like- \\nminded partner countries and actors. I will also help USAID partner with counter-\\nparts in the Philippines to work toward minimizing conflict. \\nQuestion. What actions will you take to push back against the authoritarian play-\\nbook of repression in the Indo-Pacific and make investments in democracy pro-\\nmotion rule of law and the protection of human rights? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I plan to take several actions to push back against the au-\\nthoritarian playbook of repression in the Indo-Pacific and make investments in de-\\nmocracy promotion rule of law and the protection of human rights. Following on \\nfrom the Administration\\u2019s successful first Summit for Democracy in December 2021 \\nI understand that USAID is launching new global democracy human rights and \\ngovernance (DRG) programs that will complement ongoing DRG programming that \\nsupports fundamental democratic practices across the Asia Pacific. I understand \\nthat these new and ongoing programs include objectives to promote election imple-\\nmentation and oversight enhance civil society\\u2014including women youth and labor \\nengagements bolster free media fight corruption build governing capacity and \\nstrengthen the rule of law. \\nAlso I understand that USAID will continue to promote transparent accountable \\nand responsive institutions that build sustainable democracy and counter corrup-\\ntion. I further understand that USAID will also work to maintain the integrity of \\ninformation technology spaces promote and protect civil and political rights \\nstrengthen the integrity of electoral processes and support democratic champions \\nwherever they are. \\nUsing the strength of its field missions with dedicated career DRG officers my \\nunderstanding is that USAID focuses most of its assistance on bilateral programs \\nmanaged by in-country staff. \\nPrograms and approaches vary according to the country\\u2019s context. However for \\nissues that are better addressed regionally I understand that the Asia Bureau de-\\nvelops programs that are managed either from Washington or its regional missions. \\nQuestion. As noted in the Administration\\u2019s Indo-Pacific Strategy the Indo-Pacific \\nis \\u2018\\u2018the epicenter of the climate crisis.\\u2019\\u2019 If confirmed how will you work with partners \\nand allies to ensure the international community provides adequate funding to ad-\\ndress issues of both climate change mitigation and adaptation in this vulnerable re-\\ngion? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work with partners and allies to ensure the inter-\\nnational community provides adequate funding to address issues of both climate \\nchange mitigation and adaptation in this vulnerable region. I understand that \\nUSAID helps to build climate resilience across Asia assisting their partner coun-\\ntries to address climate impacts on their doorsteps and reduce their climate impacts. \\nTheir assistance helps reduce emissions protect critical ecosystems accelerate \\nAsia\\u2019s transition to renewable energy and build resilience against climate shocks. \\nAchieving climate results through non-climate programs is critical to mainstreaming \\nclimate. I also understand that USAID pursues secondary objectives with indirect \\nadaptation clean energy or sustainable landscape results where appropriate while \\nstaying focused on their primary development purpose. \\nThe USAID Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (PEP) is one example \\nof a unique multi donor clean energy initiative cost-shared in collaboration with \\nAustralia Japan and New Zealand.

RISCH \\nQuestion. Based on the strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri it\\u2019s clear that the \\nTaliban are providing sanctuary for Al Qaeda. In addition recent U.N. reports indi-\\ncate that the Taliban and Al Qaeda remain tied by ideology and marriage and al \\nQaeda is actively reestablishing a presence in Afghanistan. Furthermore the \\nTaliban\\u2019s human rights record is appalling as evidenced by a recent Amnesty Inter-\\nnational report titled Death in Slow Motion which captures the plight of Afghan \\nwomen and girls. \\n\\u2022 How do you intend to strike the right balance between providing for the needs \\nof the Afghan people and preventing diversions to terrorism or entrenching \\nhuman rights abusers? \\n\\u2022 What mechanisms are in place to avoid diversions to the Taliban or Haqqani \\nnetwork? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID has worked in challenging and conflict-affected \\nareas throughout its history and that the Agency has drawn on experiences from \\nits over 20 years in Afghanistan and other challenging environments\\u2014including \\nIraq Yemen Somalia Sudan and Colombia\\u2014to put in place strong oversight of \\nU.S. Government assistance funds. \\nI further understand that all USAID humanitarian assistance is channeled \\nthrough U.N. and international non-governmental organization partners predicated \\non validated humanitarian need and the vulnerability of the supported communities \\nand that no USG humanitarian assistance is provided to or through Taliban au-\\nthorities. \\nI further understand that while USAID has legal authorizations in place to safe-\\nguard against sanctions violations it still requires its partners to report any in-\\nstances of diversion fraud waste and abuse including incidents involving the \\nTaliban and Haqqani Network and will suspend funding if necessary. Finally I un-\\nderstand that USAID also vets key personnel of all of its implementing partners to \\nensure that no funds are diverted for nefarious purposes. \\nQuestion. In the West Bank and Gaza USAID has a formal definition of \\u2018direct \\nbenefit\\u2019 that is operationalized in associated Mission Orders. \\n\\u2022 What definition of direct benefit is USAID using in Afghanistan? \\n\\u2022 Please describe the categories of USAID assistance to Afghanistan and the in-\\ntended goals of such assistance. \\nAnswer. \\u2018\\u2018Direct assistance\\u2019\\u2019 is not defined legally and the term is not otherwise \\na term of art. I understand that USAID has been coordinating with the Department \\nof State on application of the restriction and that State and USAID have agreed the \\nscope of the restriction needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. I further un-\\nderstand that because the United States has not yet made a decision as to whether \\nto recognize any entity including the Taliban as the Government of Afghanistan \\nthe provision of assistance raises difficult questions regarding its potential applica-\\ntion to Afghan Government entities (such as ministries etc. which continue to exist \\nand operate regardless of any U.S. recognition decision). It is my understanding that \\nState and USAID expect that the restriction would apply to any assistance provided \\ndirectly to the Taliban as a group and could also apply to entities controlled by the \\nTaliban depending on the circumstances. \\nI understand that USAID is doing a great deal alongside its international part-\\nners to address Afghanistan\\u2019s most urgent humanitarian needs. The United States \\nis the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and targets \\nits humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable populations focusing on prov-\\ninces where levels of food insecurity are the most dire and where partners have an \\noperational presence and the capacity to scale up. \\nHumanitarian assistance is necessary but not sufficient to help Afghanistan be-\\ncome economically capable of supporting its population. Therefore I understand \\nthat USAID classifies non-HA assistance into two main areas of support: 1: basic \\nneeds through support to livelihoods and agriculture education and health sectors; \\nand 2: human rights and importantly the rights of women and girls. \\nIn health I understand that USAID programs support the COVID\\u201319 pandemic \\nresponse; help maintain basic service delivery particularly maternal health serv-\\nices prenatal and neonatal care; and increase access to water sanitation and hy-\\ngiene. \\nI understand that livelihood assistance is helping to minimize the impact of eco-\\nnomic disruption and instability on vulnerable households.

If confirmed I will work with the staff to develop a strategic vision for \\nthe Bureau that provides for clear goals and objectives while promoting cross-col-\\nlaboration among teams. I will empower teams to develop contextualized implemen-\\ntation plans with clearly stated goals and results that derive from and support the \\nAsia Bureau strategic vision and its priorities. I will also work with Bureau staff \\nto continually highlight the importance of our unified vision and the factors that \\nmake for a successful \\u2018\\u2018Team Asia\\u2019\\u2019 and ultimately a successful USAID. Where nec-\\nessary I will strengthen the Bureau\\u2019s various mechanisms for accountability and \\ntransparency including performance reports site visits robust program evaluations \\nand audits if confirmed. \\nQuestion. How would you describe your management style? \\nAnswer. I would describe my management style as vision-driven and results-ori-\\nented. My goal is to create an inclusive team-oriented environment where staff are \\nheld accountable for achieving results and feel empowered and supported by man-\\nagement. I believe in an inclusive open and collaborative approach to management \\none that seeks to create an environment of constant feedback and learning for a cul-\\nture that thrives on the free expression of ideas and unleashes the creative potential \\nof the workforce. I believe in the importance of working across and with the entire \\norganization to develop a shared strategic vision; translate that into practical meas-\\nurable implementable steps; align organizational resources and activities to do so\\u2014 \\nin an environment of shared ownership and mutual accountability. Clear commu-\\nnication candid feedback and flexible decentralized decision-making that empowers \\nemployees to own and direct their own work that monitors accountability and facili-\\ntates implementation and that recognizes that different individuals and teams have \\ndifferent needs are in my view key to a management approach that can create a \\nhigh-performing resilient and humane workplace. \\nQuestion. In your view how would your management style translate in a USAID \\nsetting where your workforce is composed of career foreign and civil servants as \\nwell as a dizzying array of political appointees Foreign Service Limited appoint-\\nments Participating Agency Service Agreements contractors and grantees? \\nAnswer. My transparent and agile management style would allow me to effec-\\ntively balance the Bureau\\u2019s competing priorities while holding everyone accountable \\nfor achieving the overall Agency and U.S. Government foreign policy objectives. Al-\\nthough USAID has a variety of hiring mechanisms it is a workforce that has a com-\\npetitive edge in being united by a common goal and a shared mission. Given the \\ncomplex and dispersed nature of many of USAID\\u2019s programs if confirmed I intend \\nto work with my colleagues to help create build and sustain an organization for all \\nemployees at all levels one that draws on our shared dependence and the commit-\\nment of all the members of the organization. I am also strongly of the view that \\ndiversity in a workforce including diverse perspectives that come from different ca-\\nreer experiences and modes of professional engagement only strengthen an organi-\\nzation providing valuable insight that strengthen the ability of an organization to \\nmake better decisions be more adaptive and engage more effectively and creatively. \\nQuestion. As a political appointee rather than career foreign or civil servant do \\nyou believe it is incumbent upon Agency leaders to integrate themselves into bureau \\noperations and culture? If yes how do you intend to do so? \\nAnswer. Yes. If confirmed I intend to immerse myself in understanding the nu-\\nances of USAID by listening to the Bureau\\u2019s workforce both in DC and in the field \\nto ensure I fully understand the current objectives programs workstyle and organi-\\nzational strengths\\u2014and especially given the challenges of the past several years \\nand the changing nature of work what the needs and aspirations of the organiza-\\ntion look like within the broader construct of USAID operations ambitions and cul-\\nture. If confirmed I plan to seek the views perspectives and ideas of the widest \\npossible range of staff and to work together with my team so that we can establish \\na clear vision and set of goals and objectives that is communicated throughout the \\nbureau to other elements of USAID and the USG and to our implementing part-\\nners. I am acutely aware of the importance of understanding and being sensitive \\nto different modes and methods of communication aspirational thinking and orga-\\nnizational habits\\u2014to marry the \\u2018\\u2018policy\\u2019\\u2019 goals that the Biden-Harris administration \\nseeks to pursue with an appreciation of USAID \\u2018\\u2018process\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018practice\\u2019\\u2019 (or in other \\nwords culture)\\u2014to get things done and done in a way that creates positive feed-\\nback virtuous cycles a healthy motivated workforce and forward organizational \\nmomentum. \\nQuestion.

In order to incentivize and ensure employee excellence at USAID accu-\\nrate performance reviews for all categories of employees are critical though often \\nlacking. Do you believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate con-\\nstructive feedback on their performance in order to encourage improvement and re-\\nward those who most succeeded in their roles? \\nAnswer. Yes I believe that it is important to provide employees with accurate \\nconstructive feedback on their performance in order to encourage improvement and \\nreward those who most succeeded in their roles. \\nQuestion. If confirmed would you support and encourage the managers in your \\nbureau to provide clear accurate and direct feedback \\nAnswer. Yes if confirmed I would support and encourage the managers in the \\nAsia bureau to provide clear accurate and direct feedback. \\nQuestion. Should the United States engage in highly risky public health re-\\nsearch\\u2014such as gain-of-function research\\u2014in cooperation with countries that do not \\nhave adequate biosecurity standards that have violated or failed to uphold the \\nInternational Health Regulations or where the United States cannot certify that \\nsuch country is in compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention including \\nChina? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID has never approved any work including in \\nChina that aimed to increase the ability of infectious agents to cause disease by \\nenhancing its pathogenicity or by increasing its transmissibility (research known as \\n\\u2018\\u2018Gain of Function \\u2019\\u2019 studies). \\nI understand that prior to selecting countries to engage with on public health re-\\nsearch activities USAID conducts an assessment of countries\\u2019 capacity to respon-\\nsibly conduct research by evaluating indicators that include but are not limited to \\nbiosafety biosecurity IHR reporting compliance willingness to share data and po-\\nlitical and security risks and that countries that underperform in these criteria are \\nnot selected for engagement. \\nQuestion. If confirmed will you ensure USAID\\u2019s research and development grants \\nfor public health research in Asia are fully vetted and do not flow to partners or \\nsub-grantees engaged in such research? How? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID will build guidance into its Global Health Secu-\\nrity projects that helps ensure implementing partners are adhering to rigorous bio-\\nsafety and biosecurity protocols. I also understand that USAID requires regular re-\\nporting on implementing partners\\u2019 activities supported with Agency funding which \\nmust adhere to the criteria laid out in the award. If confirmed I will ensure that \\nUSAID continues to provide active review and oversight of awards made with Agen-\\ncy appropriated funds to monitor activities and the use of funds and that funds do \\nnot support enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen research (i.e. research that \\nmakes a potentially pandemic virus more transmissible or pathogenic) through ei-\\nther the prime or sub-partners. \\nQuestion. If confirmed will you commit to ensuring full and complete compliance \\nwith current law which prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance to perform or \\npromote abortion as a method of family planning support involuntary sterilizations \\nor lobby for or against the legalization of abortion overseas? \\nAnswer. Yes if confirmed I commit to ensuring compliance with all applicable \\nstatutory restrictions relating to abortion and involuntary sterilization. \\nFOLLOW-UP QUESTION SUBMITTED TO ROLFE MICHAEL \\nSCHIFFER BY SENATOR JAMES E.

If confirmed will you ensure USAID\\u2019s research and development grants \\nfor public health research in Asia are fully vetted and do not flow to partners or \\nsub-grantees engaged in such research? How? \\nAnswer. Yes. I understand that USAID fully vets partners that receive public \\nhealth research funding. I understand that in accordance with USAID\\u2019s Operational \\nPolicy (ADS 303.3.9 Pre-Award Risk Assessment) this vetting includes but is not \\nlimited to requiring a USAID Agreement Officer to verify that the partner: \\n\\u2022 does not have active exclusions in the System for Award Management \\n(SAM)(beta.sam.gov); \\n\\u2022 does not appear on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) and Blocked Per-\\nsons List maintained by the U.S. Treasury for the Office of Foreign Assets Con-\\ntrol (OFAC: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDNList/Pages/ \\ndefault.aspx); and \\n\\u2022 is not listed on the United Nations Security designation List (online at: http:// \\nwww.un.org/sc/committees/1267/aq\\u2014sanctions\\u2014list.shtml) prior to making an \\naward. \\nIf confirmed I look forward to engaging with Agency leadership and with you on \\nthis issue. \\nI also understand USAID is building guidance into its Global Health Security \\nprojects with a life sciences focus to ensure implementing partners are adhering to \\nrigorous biosafety and biosecurity protocols.

If confirmed how do you propose to counter China\\u2019s vaccine diplomacy\\u2014 \\nor bullying\\u2014in the region? \\nAnswer. Yes I agree that it is in the interest of the United States and our part-\\nners for as many people as possible to be vaccinated with the highest-quality U.S.- \\nmanufactured vaccines available. To that end I understand that USAID and its \\ninteragency partners have delivered nearly 300 million doses of COVID\\u201319 vaccines \\nto 26 countries in Asia. I also understand that most of the Agency\\u2019s Indo-Pacific \\npartners have specifically asked for U.S.-manufactured vaccines. It is also my un-\\nderstanding that the U.S. contribution to COVAX was not used to purchase vaccines \\nmade in the PRC. The Biden-Harris administration is dedicated to its efforts to vac-\\ncinate the world and ensure broad availability of safe and effective vaccines to more \\ncountries in need through COVAX and bilaterally and I believe others should do \\nthe same. \\nI know that across Asia USAID assists countries with vaccine readiness vaccine \\nadvocacy campaigns and vaccine delivery.

There has been a strong focus over the last two years on multilateral \\ninstitutions to address global challenges. \\n\\u2022 Recognizing that multilateral and bilateral programs are meant to work collabo-\\nratively and that each have their own unique strengths and challenges what \\nwould you consider to be the appropriate balance between multilateral and U.S. \\nbilateral foreign assistance programs in the region? \\n\\u2022 How important to U.S. public diplomacy efforts is \\u2018\\u2018branding\\u2019\\u2019 United States for-\\neign assistance in the region? \\n\\u2022 Is working through multilateral or regional institutions worth the trade-off \\nwhen it comes to the loss of branding and other public diplomacy opportunities \\nin the region? \\nQuestion. I understand that in Asia USAID will continue to engage like-minded \\npartners directly in-country and through multilateral initiatives such as the Quad-\\nrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) U.S.-Taiwan Pacific Islands Dialogue U.S.- \\nJapan-Australia Trilateral Infrastructure Consultation the Trilateral Pacific Secu-\\nrity Dialogue and others. I further understand that USAID will continue to deepen \\nits collaboration with Australia Japan New Zealand the Republic of Korea  and \\nother like-minded partners and will seek to leverage its strong partnerships with \\nregional institutions including the Pacific Islands Forum the Association of South-\\neast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Quad. \\nOn the issue of balance between multilateral and bilateral assistance I believe \\nthat balance depends on the country and the goals to be achieved by the assistance. \\nBilateral assistance allows the USG to achieve goals that further U.S. foreign policy \\nobjectives allows for greater accountability and provides visibility around the assist-\\nance delivered. However there are advantages to using multilateral channels when \\nstriving to pool resources and advance a common global cause. For example USAID \\nmay choose to provide assistance through multilateral organizations such as the \\ncase of Burma where humanitarian assistance providers\\u2019 lives could be put at risk \\nshould the assistance be branded as USAID assistance. I also believe that a better \\noption could be a hybrid model where assistance is provided to multilateral organi-\\nzations but is earmarked for specific purposes providing USAID the advantages of \\nboth options. \\nI believe appropriate branding sends a strong public diplomacy message con-\\nveying that United States assistance is due to the generosity of the American peo-\\nple.

RISCH \\nQuestion. If confirmed how do you propose to counter China\\u2019s vaccine diplomacy\\u2014 \\nor bullying\\u2014in the region? \\nAnswer. It is my belief that the best way to counter the PRC\\u2019s efforts is for the \\nUnited States to remain the world\\u2019s arsenal for vaccines especially as there is a \\nclear preference for U.S.-made vaccines. To date USG vaccine donations have sig-\\nnificantly outpaced those by the PRC. We also need to continue being assertive in \\npublicizing our contributions; we must keep telling the story of how American inno-\\nvation and donations\\u2014our effective vaccines\\u2014have directly contributed to easing \\nthe pandemic in communities around the world. \\nThe Biden-Harris administration supports the World Health Organization\\u2019s goal \\nof vaccinating 70 percent of the global population. I understand that USAID plays \\na pivotal role in U.S. contributions to this goal by advancing the President\\u2019s commit-\\nment to make doses available for donation to low- and lower-middle-income coun-\\ntries and that the U.S. has been able to meet vaccine demand for 116 countries who \\nhave requested doses. I understand that USAID will also continue to provide finan-\\ncial and technical assistance to deliver and administer vaccines through our leader-\\nship of the U.S. Government\\u2019s Initiative for Global Vaccine Access (Global VAX) \\nthrough which USAID has supported more than 100 countries. If confirmed I will \\nwork with Congress to ensure these programs are adequately funded. \\nQuestion. Successive Administrations\\u2014both Democrat and Republican\\u2014have \\nlaunched initiatives to \\u2018\\u2018localize\\u2019\\u2019 U.S. foreign assistance including by building the \\ncapacity of local partners to design programs and manage U.S. funds directly rather \\nthan working as sub-awardees to large U.S.-based development contractors and \\nnon-governmental organizations. Each of these initiatives has had mixed results. \\n\\u2022 What is your view of \\u2018\\u2018localization\\u2019\\u2019 in the context of USAID\\u2019s work in Asia? \\n\\u2022 How can the Bureau for Asia more effectively empower local partners through \\nits program consultation design and implementation processes? \\n\\u2022 Is it appropriate to set targets for \\u2018\\u2018localization\\u2019\\u2019 and if so what would you con-\\nsider to be reasonable and appropriate? \\nAnswer. I support the vision of localization Administrator Power presented in her \\nNovember 2021 speech at Georgetown University \\u2018\\u2018A New Vision for Inclusive De-\\nvelopment\\u2019\\u2019 in which she outlined USAID\\u2019s commitment to build on past efforts in \\nmaking its work more inclusive; and that the Agency will pursue this in part \\nthrough localization. I understand that USAID will shift its programs and practices \\nto expand and enhance its support for locally-led development the process in which \\nlocal actors\\u2014encompassing individuals communities networks organizations pri-\\nvate entities and governments\\u2014set their own agendas develop solutions and bring \\nthe capacity leadership and resources to make those solutions a reality. I agree \\nwith Administrator Power that around the world when USAID\\u2019s efforts are respon-\\nsive to local priorities and draw upon local capacities diverse networks and re-\\nsources\\u2014results are more likely to be sustained by local organizations and institu-\\ntions. \\nFor the Agency and the Asia Bureau I understand localization to mean chan-\\nneling a portion of development and humanitarian awards directly to local civil soci-\\nety business and other institutions that are supported by and accountable to local \\ncommunities. It means changing the power dynamics that have historically charac-\\nterized the relationships among local actors international prime partners and do-\\nnors with renewed focus on empowering local actors-and within that goal ensuring \\nmeaningful participation by marginalized populations including women people with \\ndisabilities youth indigenous populations displaced persons and ethnic and reli-\\ngious minorities. \\nI think it is appropriate to set targets to help motivate and track the Agency\\u2019s \\nlocalization efforts. I understand that the targets that the Administrator announced \\nin November-25% of USAID\\u2019s funding going to direct local awards over four years \\nand 50% of the Agency\\u2019s activities incorporating good practices to put local actors \\nin the lead over ten years-are global targets. If confirmed I look forward to con-\\nsulting with Congress and with the Bureau and Mission staff to identify appro-\\npriate targets given the unique context of the region. \\nQuestion.

Yes if confirmed I commit to advancing policies and programs with our \\npartner countries that make sense for them and will not outright reject any develop-\\nment solution to help our partners to meet their energy needs. \\nI understand that USAID has an adjudication process for reviewing fossil fuel \\nprojects under the Administration\\u2019s International Energy Engagement Guidance. I \\nam told that this guidance allows for support of carbon intensive energy sources \\nnecessary for geostrategic or development reasons when no other practical alter-\\nnatives exist and the assistance will not prevent a country from meeting its \\ndecarbonization objectives. \\nAs I understand USAID\\u2019s approach to energy sector reform and smart growth is \\nto provide partner countries with the tools and capability needed to evaluate all of \\ntheir options through an integrated resource planning (IRP) methodology. In addi-\\ntion I understand that USAID assists countries in establishing open transparent \\ncompetitive procurement processes in order to obtain clean affordable and secure \\nenergy supplies. \\nQuestion. Do you commit to prioritizing infrastructure partners in the Indo-Pacific \\nregion including through mechanisms such as the Infrastructure Transaction and \\nAssistance Network and the related Transaction Advisory Fund? \\nAnswer. Yes. \\nQuestion. The President just announced the Project on Global Infrastructure and \\nInvestment (PGII) and you mentioned in your opening statement that you would \\nbe involved in its implementation. \\n\\u2022 What is PGII\\u2019s purpose? \\n\\u2022 How will PGII and USAID existing infrastructure programs and tools interact? \\nIs PGII going to subsume any responsibilities of USAID? \\nAnswer. As I understand the purpose of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure \\nand Investment (PGII) is to forge values-driven transparent impactful partnerships \\nto meet the enormous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries and \\nin so doing to advance the United States\\u2019 and our allies\\u2019 economic and national se-\\ncurity interests-for example the integrity of supply chains. \\nPGII will mobilize strategic investments in areas vital to sustainable development \\nand global security including digital connectivity; climate and energy security; \\nhealth and health security; and gender equality and equity. It will also mobilize \\nstrategic investment in hard infrastructure like ports and rail. \\nTo do this PGII will promote the execution of projects in consultation and part-\\nnership with host countries and local stakeholders develop clean and climate-resil-\\nient infrastructure advance transparency and accountability and support the policy \\nand institutional reforms that are key to creating the conditions and capacity for \\nsound projects and lasting results. PGII will coordinate the full suite of tools across \\nthe U.S. Government as well as the G7 other governments the private sector mul-\\ntilateral development banks development finance institutions and others. \\nThe U.S. aims to mobilize $200 billion for PGII over the next five years through \\ngrants federal financing and leveraging private sector investments.

With respect to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands what would be \\nyour top priorities if confirmed? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID considers its Pacific neighbors essential part-\\nners in fostering a free and open Indo-Pacific region and that USAID works to ad-\\ndress the region\\u2019s most pressing challenges: climate change access to transparent \\nand high-standard infrastructure financing digital connectivity good governance \\nand sustainable development. \\nWorking with Pacific Island countries to bolster their nature-based solutions in-\\ncluding conservation of critical ecosystems and sustainable management of fisheries \\nwill strengthen livelihoods support sustainable and healthy communities and eco-\\nsystems and reduce the impacts of climate-related disasters. \\nI understand USAID plans to continue to deepen its work with countries in \\nSoutheast Asia and that USAID will also leverage its strong partnerships with de-\\nvelopment partners and regional institutions including ASEAN thePacific Islands \\nForum the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the \\nlongstanding Pacific Community also known as SPC. Building and maintaining \\nthese partnerships will be essential to advancing Administration priorities such as \\naddressing the climate crisis recovering from the COVID\\u201319 pandemic countering \\nmalign actors and addressing Burma\\u2019s humanitarian challenges while seeking to \\nrestore democratic governance. \\nQuestion. With respect to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands] What do you \\nsee as major barriers to providing the right and most effective assistance and pro-\\ngramming in these regions? \\nAnswer. Pacific Islands countries face a range of barriers including small geo-\\ngraphic size isolation and small populations. These factors contribute to the re-\\ngion\\u2019s extreme vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters \\nas well as constrain the growth of their economies. I understand that USAID\\u2019s ap-\\nproach to the Pacific Islands supports addressing the most pressing priorities of the \\nregion . These priorities include combating climate change sustainable fisheries \\nmanagement promoting energy security expanding digital connectivity supporting \\neconomic development and fostering inclusivity and equality. Effective program-\\nming in this region requires working at both the regional level where there are op-\\nportunities to drive collective action and ensure strong unity within key regional or-\\nganizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Pacific Community as well \\nas at the bilateral level using programming tailored to fit the unique context of \\neach country. \\nCountries across Southeast Asia are facing the immediate risks of climate change; \\nrapid urbanization; and the overexploitation and contamination of life-sustaining re-\\nsources of the land air and sea. Barriers remain to stronger regional connectivity \\nsustainable infrastructure development and commitment to democratic principles \\nand freedoms. Through sustainable inclusive development partnerships such as the \\nquadrilateral cooperation between Australia India Japan and the United States \\n(the Quad) and with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) I under-\\nstand that USAID supports developing countries in Asia to realize their develop-\\nment goals and contribute to a more prosperous and peaceful world. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how will you prioritize USAID programming under the \\nCountering Chinese Influence Fund (CCIF)? What will be your guideposts? \\nAnswer. Consistent with the FY 2022 State Foreign Operations and Related Pro-\\ngrams Appropriations Act (SFOAA) if confirmed my work on the Countering Peo-\\nple\\u2019s Republic of China Influence Fund (CPIF) will be done in close consultation \\nwith the designated Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator for the FY 2022 CPIF allo-\\ncation process. \\nMy understanding is that USAID\\u2019s priorities will align with both the wider U.S. \\nGovernment strategy on China as well as the Agency\\u2019s newly formed strategic ap-\\nproach to the People\\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with a focus on select economic po-\\nlitical security and technological sectors where PRC actions influence or mes-\\nsaging is most acute is most detrimental to U.S. national security interests or those \\nof our allies and partners and where limited CPIF resources can have the greatest \\nimpact. While the PRC\\u2019s efforts to displace the United States as the lead global \\npower are a global multi-sector threat the Indo-Pacific remains the primary theater \\nof competition and will receive strong consideration for CPIF resources. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00095\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n96 \\nQuestion. In the last several years the executive branch has notified Congress \\nprojects using CCIF money that is clearly an attempt to use China as a justification \\nto fund programs they already wanted to do anyway and that have no discernible \\nnexus to countering China. Do you commit that you will not contribute to this dy-\\nnamic? \\nAnswer. I commit that if confirmed as Assistant Administrator for the Bureau \\nfor Asia I will work to ensure that proposals are closely aligned with one of four \\nfocus areas (sectors) for strategic competition: economic political security and/or \\ntechnology and must articulate how the intended program will address a specific \\nnegative PRC influence action or message resulting in a measurable impact \\nQuestion. How will you use your leadership role if confirmed to ensure CCIF \\nfunds are used appropriately? \\nAnswer. If confirmed as Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Asia I com-\\nmit to engaging with Congress as appropriate and necessary to ensure that the \\nprocess is rigorous and that funds are used appropriately. \\nQuestion. Should bureaus and offices in the Department of State and the U.S. \\nAgency for International Development consider CCIF to be a $300 million pot of \\nmoney that they can use for whatever they want regardless of whether it is con-\\nnected to China? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID received clear feedback from Congress on how \\nto improve its process of the Countering PRC Influence Fund (CPIF) for FY 2022 \\nand beyond. Per their recent Report to Congress on The Framework and Processes \\nfor Administering the Countering PRC Influence Fund the Department of State and \\nUSAID\\u2019s FY 2022 guidance requires successful proposals to articulate how the in-\\ntended program will address a specific negative PRC influence action or message \\nresulting in a measurable impact. \\nIf confirmed I will work together with my counterpart at the Department of \\nState to ensure our teams apply rigorous standards to determine how CPIF funds \\nwill be used. If confirmed I commit to further consulting with you on this issue. \\nQuestion. In the context of CCIF to what extent will you distinguish between \\nprojects that might strengthen our partners and those that counter explicit activity \\nor influence by the People\\u2019s Republic of China? \\nAnswer. I understand that CPIF is intended to provide the Department of State \\nand USAID with resources to fund activities that strategically invest align and \\ncompete with the PRC\\u2019s negative and inappropriate influence actions and mes-\\nsaging globally and provide our partners with diplomatic and development alter-\\nnatives to the PRC\\u2019s authoritarian model. In some instances this can be accom-\\nplished by directly countering an explicit activity influence effort or messaging \\ncampaign by the PRC. In other instances strengthening the systems capacity and \\nresilience of USAID partner countries to resist the PRC on their own can be equally \\nas effective. Transparent accountable systems based on a rules-based order inhibit \\nthe PRC development model so strengthening those systems limits opportunity for \\nthe negative impact of the PRC. For example both transparent public procurement \\nsystems and active civil society that hold politicians accountable for public asset dec-\\nlarations effectively decrease the opportunity for corruption undermining inappro-\\npriate PRC influence. \\nWhile both approaches are valid ways to achieve the same objective I understand \\nthat all proposals will be expected to cite a specific PRC influence or behavior that \\nharms U.S. interests or those of USAID partner countries; describe the specific \\nmeasurable outcome to be achieved using CPIF funds; and articulate how the pro-\\nposal would achieve this outcome and the duration of the project\\u2019s lifespan. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO ROLFE MICHAEL SCHIFFER BY SENATOR MARCO RUBIO \\nQuestion. In May Secretary Blinken said that the People\\u2019s Republic of China is \\nthe \\u2018\\u2018only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and in-\\ncreasingly the economic diplomatic military and technological power to do it.\\u2019\\u2019 The \\nChinese Communist Party (CCP) clearly holds all the reins of power in the People\\u2019s \\nRepublic of China and has used this power to commit genocide in Xinjiang flood \\nour communities with fentanyl and emit by far the largest quantity of greenhouse \\ngases. With their absolute control of Chinese society and industry the CCP could \\nstop all of these destructive actions tomorrow if they so choose. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00096\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n97 \\n\\u2022 Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States? \\nAnswer. Yes. The Chinese Communist Party aims to challenge the U.S.-led model \\ncharacterized by democratic governance and open markets which has succeeded at \\ndelivering vital public services equitably and preserving sovereignty. This model is \\nthe best system to build just inclusive and prosperous societies. \\nMany of the actions that Beijing is pursuing are detrimental to U.S. national se-\\ncurity and development interests. Across regions and in multilateral fora the PRC \\nis attempting to undermine U.S. investments in key development sectors ranging \\nfrom natural resources management to human rights protection. This poses signifi-\\ncant risks to U.S. partner countries\\u2019 autonomy stability and prosperity and re-\\nquires us to confront the PRC from a position of strength-to be competitive when \\nwe should be countering when we must be and collaborate only when it is in our \\nnational interest. \\nIf confirmed I would use all tools available to counter this challenge such as \\nworking with USAID\\u2019s Anti-Corruption Task Force and Center for Democracy \\nHuman Rights and Governance to combat the CCP\\u2019s corruptive practices and use \\nof corrosive capital\\u2014which in part is how the PRC convinces countries to sign up \\nto its Belt and Road Initiative. In contrast to the PRC\\u2019s state-led backroom deals \\nif confirmed I would further USAID\\u2019s engagements with the private sector and civil \\nsociety to counter the PRC\\u2019s state-led development model that undermines the fi-\\nnancial and resource independence of our partner countries. \\nQuestion. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities that are \\nbeneficial to U.S. interests? \\nAnswer. As outlined in my response above we are currently witnessing a Chinese \\nCommunist Party (CCP) unwilling to work for the greater good of populations \\naround the world and take actions that are detrimental to U.S. interests. \\nIf confirmed I would further USAID\\u2019s activities in building resilient supply \\nchains combating forced labor lessening trade distortions and furthering demo-\\ncratic values. \\nQuestion. If confirmed will you approve any joint activity with organizations or \\nrepresentatives from the People\\u2019s Republic of China as part of your work? \\nAnswer. Such a pivotal cooperation decision would require extensive high level \\ndiscussion in the Executive Branch and deep consultation with Congress. The law \\nmust be our guide: I am well aware of legal restrictions regarding assistance to the \\nPRC and in the provision of U.S. assistance including in appropriations legislation. \\nQuestion. By virtue of its geography and a decades-long program of dam building \\nthe Chinese Communist Party retains significant control over the Mekong River \\nbasin a source of water food and energy for more than 65 million people. At the \\npress of a button the CCP could stop the flow of water to downstream countries \\nwhich would cause an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that would destabilize the \\nregion and send even more migrants to our unprotected southern border. \\n\\u2022 Are you concerned with the prospect of a humanitarian crisis in the Mekong \\nRiver Basin caused by the Chinese Communist Party? Please explain. \\nAnswer. I am always concerned about actions that the Chinese Communist Party \\ncould take that might negatively impact Indo-Pacific countries especially those in \\nSoutheast Asia and the United States. \\nThe cascade of dams built by the Chinese Communist Party exacerbate the im-\\npacts that climate change is already having on the health of the river and on the \\ncountries in the Mekong Basin. \\nUSAID has been instrumental in understanding the impacts of these dams sup-\\nporting the Stimson Center to develop and launch the Mekong Infrastructure track-\\ner to better understand the spatial extent and impacts of dams and other infrastruc-\\nture in the river basin. I understand that programs like SERVIR Mekong out of the \\nRegional Development Mission for Asia based in Bangkok Thailand have devel-\\noped tools like digital rain gauges and vegetation assessments to track and docu-\\nment the ongoing changes within the basin. USAID programs provide the data and \\nevidence to document the risks of further dam construction while supporting non- \\nhydro renewable energy for downstream Mekong countries. \\nI also understand that the impacts of dams on fisheries is the reason for the cre-\\nation of the USAID \\u2018\\u2018Wonders of the Mekong\\u2019\\u2019 program. I understand that this pro-\\ngram works to understand fish movements throughout the Mekong systems the im-\\npacts of the variety of dams on fish populations and advocates for environmental \\nand social safeguards to protect a healthy Mekong ecosystem providing for the food \\nsecurity of the region. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00097\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n98 \\nFinally it is my understanding that USAID has long partnered with the ASEAN \\nSecretariat\\u2019s regional humanitarian response unit to strengthen ASEAN\\u2019s ability to \\nsupport disaster response in the region both regionally and bilaterally. I further un-\\nderstand that USAID has teams on standby 24/7 all around the world including in \\nSoutheast Asia ready to deploy to a range of humanitarian crises. \\nQuestion. How is the United States working with downstream Mekong countries \\nto ensure these counties are resilient to the effects of a CCP-sparked humanitarian \\ncrisis? \\nAnswer. As I understand one of USAID\\u2019s most pressing priorities is to help part-\\nner countries including those in the Mekong region develop their capacity to be re-\\nsilient to a range of crises. \\nUSAID bilaterally and regionally works towards resilience through agriculture \\nand environment programs. I understand that USAID\\u2019s efforts for resilience to the \\nchanges in river flows caused by the CCP and climate change include monitoring \\nenvironmental conditions early warning systems and conservation. For example on \\nmonitoring the USAID-funded Mekong Infrastructure Tracker platform is the pre-\\nmier resource for researchers to track monitor and quantify the development of en-\\nergy transportation and water infrastructure assets and the social economic and \\necological changes they bring to Southeast Asia. On conservation the Wonders of \\nthe Mekong Program in Cambodia is rearing endangered fish and releasing them \\nin efforts to increase fish stocks and ecosystem health which contributes to Cam-\\nbodians\\u2019 food security. \\nI further understand that USAID has long partnered with the ASEAN Secretar-\\niat\\u2019s regional humanitarian response unit to strengthen ASEAN\\u2019s ability to support \\ndisaster response in the region both regionally and bilaterally. I also understand \\nthat the Vietnam Mission is specifically focusing on more bilateral work in the \\nMekong including the Mekong Delta Coastal Habitat Conservation activity which \\nwas announced by Vice President Harris during her visit to Vietnam in 2021. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what types of programming do you recommend USAID \\nsupport in Mekong River countries to further ensure these countries are resistant \\nto water shocks? \\nAnswer. As I understand USAID has been tracking the impacts of large-scale hy-\\ndropower dams and climate change on the Mekong River Basin through a variety \\nof activities. \\nI understand that USAID works with countries in the Lower Mekong region as \\nwell as the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to build capacity to address water \\nshocks and other adverse environmental impacts. For example the USAID SERVIR- \\nMekong initiative a partnership with NASA harnesses remote sensing technology \\nand open data to help address development challenges related to a changing cli-\\nmate. I also understand that the MRC recently endorsed USAID SERVIR-Mekong\\u2019s \\nflood forecasting and reservoir assessment tools improving climate resilience across \\nthe Lower Mekong. I understand that USAID SERVIR-Mekong partnered with the \\nMRC to develop decision support tools that assist member countries to better pre-\\npare for and respond to floods and droughts. \\nI further understand that the USAID-supported Wonders of the Mekong Program \\nhas generated new insights on the drought-flood cycle in Cambodia. This new re-\\nsearch which has been featured in National Geographic and other major outlets \\nhas resulted in the Government of Cambodia calling for a moratorium on dams. The \\nCambodian Government has also prohibited the cutting of flooded forests which will \\ncontribute to improving the health of the Mekong River system and the communities \\ndependent upon them. \\nI further understand that through the Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in \\nResearch (PEER) activity USAID supports a network of Lower Mekong scientists \\nto better understand the impacts of hydropower and climate change on Mekong fish-\\neries. This network of scientists is positioned to improve fisheries management by \\ncharacterizing genetic diversity and spatial structure as well as establishing long- \\nterm monitoring of important fish species in Cambodia Laos Burma Thailand and \\nVietnam. The scientists are working to understand the impact of rapid hydroelectric \\ndevelopment in the Lower Mekong Basin on fisheries. \\nQuestion. In contrast to the Chinese Communist Party which continues to have \\nstrained relations with many of its neighbors foreign assistance provided by the \\nUnited States has enabled its allies and partners to become foreign assistance pro-\\nviders themselves. The Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Ja-\\npan\\u2019s International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have provided assistance and sup-\\nport to countries in Southeast and Central Asia.

What programs have and have not worked \\npreviously? \\nAnswer. I understand that USAID\\u2019s development assistance to the Republic of \\nKorea decades ago not only helped the country develop into the global leader that \\nit is today but it also helped the country develop its own very capable international \\ndevelopment agency. \\nCooperation with Japan advances U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. \\nI understand that USAID works to align development policy and resources with \\nJapan to enhance development impacts with like-minded allies through diplomatic \\nefforts in Washington DC and through the USAID Senior Development Counselor \\nto Japan and Korea. \\nFinally my understanding is that USAID has made a strategic decision to work \\nwith key emerging leaders in the Indo-Pacific to help them strengthen their own de-\\nvelopment agencies including India Thailand Kazakhstan and others. Strength-\\nening our Indo-Pacific partners\\u2019 ability to improve their neighbors\\u2019 development is \\ngood strategy good diplomacy and good for the U.S. taxpayer. \\nQuestion. USAID currently manages co-funded programs with Australia\\u2019s Depart-\\nment of Foreign Affairs and Trade in countries like Sri Lanka and the Maldives. \\nTo what extent can this model inform joint projects with Korea and Japan\\u2019s foreign \\naid agencies? \\nAnswer. I understand that collaborating with like-minded donors including Aus-\\ntralia Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of USAID\\u2019s highest imperatives. \\nThese partnerships allow USAID to maximize its development investments and pro-\\ngramming by avoiding duplicative efforts and promoting policy alignment. It is good \\nstrategy good diplomacy and good for the U.S. taxpayer. \\nMy understanding is that USAID has strong existing relationships with Japan \\nand the Republic of Korea and works closely with both Ministries of Foreign Af-\\nfairs the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) the Korea International \\nCooperation Agency (KOICA) and other government and private sector stakeholders. \\nI understand that USAID is engaged in a number of co-funded programs with the \\nRepublic of Korea and Japan including the USAID-KOICA Climate Resilient Cities \\nas well as the Marine Litter activities and the Japan-Power Africa collaboration. I \\nunderstand that USAID plans to build on the successes of such collaborations with \\nthe Republic of Korea and Japan by incorporating the lessons learned that the \\nAgency has gleaned from our bilateral engagements with DFAT and other like- \\nminded partners. I look forward to contributing to these efforts if confirmed. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what will you do to encourage greater USAID cooperation \\nand coordination with Korea and Japan\\u2019s foreign aid agencies? \\nAnswer. My understanding is that USAID has strong existing relationships with \\nJapan and Korea and works closely with both Ministries for Foreign Affairs the \\nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Korea International Co-\\noperation Agency (KOICA) among other key Japanese and Korean stakeholders. I \\nunderstand that USAID\\u2019s Senior Development Counselor for Japan and Korea \\nbased in Embassy Tokyo is working to strengthen the Agency\\u2019s strategic engage-\\nment with the Japanese Government and is similarly focused on growing USAID\\u2019s \\nrelationship with the Korean Government. \\nI also understand that USAID has frequent engagement with Japan\\u2019s and Korea\\u2019s \\nembassies JICA and KOICA in the field and will continue to build and capitalize \\non this partnership. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD SUBMITTED \\nTO ROLFE MICHAEL SCHIFFER BY SENATOR TODD YOUNG \\nQuestion.

I under-\\nstand that at the end of FY 2021 USAID completed a successful hiring surge to \\nreach the previous staffing appropriations levels of 1850 FS and 1600 CS positions. \\nHowever given the significant expansion of USAID\\u2019s work around the world I un-\\nderstand that the Agency estimates its real staffing requirements are significantly \\nhigher in both Foreign Service and Civil Service categories. \\nI further understand that USAID\\u2019s Office of Human Capital and Talent Manage-\\nment (HCTM) is focusing on hiring efforts to streamline and diversify the Agency\\u2019s \\nhiring processes. For example as part of USAID\\u2019s General Schedule (GS) process \\nI understand that HCTM is developing a hiring manager guide and conducting \\nwebinars to educate hiring managers across USAID on their role non-competitive \\nhiring authorities and timelines in the hiring process. \\nI understand that USAID is working to attract and retain the brightest minds \\nthat will help the Agency achieve its mission by engaging and recruiting diverse \\nquality talent through targeted outreach and recruitment events including via ef-\\nforts to expand and maintain partnerships with organizations serving underrep-\\nresented groups to source eligible candidates for employment opportunities. I fur-\\nther understand that USAID has expanded its talent sourcing efforts by partnering \\nwith organizations that serve persons with disabilities and veterans to source can-\\ndidates eligible for non-competitive employment consideration. If confirmed I look \\nforward to supporting these efforts. \\nQuestion. Noting food supply disruptions as a result of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine what tools can Congress provide to ensure USAID can fulfill its mission? \\nAnswer. I understand that the generous resources provided by Congress through \\nthe Ukraine supplemental appropriations bills have been critical to USAID\\u2019s ability \\nto scale up humanitarian and development assistance to respond to the food security \\ncrisis resulting from Russia\\u2019s unjustified invasion of Ukraine. However given the \\nscale of global food insecurity and the dynamic nature of its causes it is imperative \\nthat USAID fully optimize its programs and be able to employ the best food assist-\\nance modalities to respond to each context. I understand that the reauthorization \\nof the Farm Bill may provide an unparalleled opportunity for Congress and USAID \\nto work together to ensure the U.S. Government has the best tools at its disposal \\nto meet the humanitarian challenges of the day. If confirmed I look forward to \\nworking with colleagues across the Agency on these issues and to consulting with \\nCongress on these issues. \\nQuestion. Given the confluence of so many crises where should USAID look to \\nfirst prioritize its efforts? \\nAnswer. I understand that the Agency\\u2019s priorities for Asia are guided by President \\nBiden\\u2019s 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy the Central Asia Strategy and the U.S. Interim \\nNational Security Strategy. From briefings with USAID career staff I also under-\\nstand that the Asia Bureau has released a pro-active and affirmative Indo-Pacific \\nframework that will operationalize the President\\u2019s Indo-Pacific Strategy with on- \\ngoing and planned USAID programs. If confirmed I look forward to delving into the \\ndetails of USAID\\u2019s approach to the Indo-Pacific and to consulting with you on these \\nissues. \\nQuestion. Regarding U.S. strategy on Burma if the military junta disrupts \\nUSAID\\u2019s ability to interact with its implementing partners on the ground how do \\nyou propose we work around this to guarantee a continuous supply of U.S. aid? \\nAnswer. USAID\\u2019s robust work in Burma continues and is more critical than ever. \\nUSAID has historical and recent experience managing aid globally in unstable and \\nconflict-affected environments. I understand that USAID continuously adjusts ap-\\nproaches and strategies on the ground to avoid aid bottlenecks. For example I un-\\nderstand that the Agency has diversified and expanded its use of local partners who \\nmay have better access and fewer restrictions to deliver food aid and other assist-\\nance to vulnerable communities. Additionally as publicly announced on February \\n11 2021 just 10 days after the coup I understand that the USAID Mission pivoted \\n$42.4 million of FY 2020 bilateral assistance funds away from development work \\nthat could have benefited the military government. This shift primarily within ex-\\nisting awards increased aid to civil society and non-governmental actors across all \\nsectors. I understand that since then the Mission has continued this model to de-\\nsign and implement work across all sectors in ways that do not work through or \\nbenefit Burma\\u2019s military government. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00100\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n101 \\nOn humanitarian assistance I understand that the bulk of humanitarian assist-\\nance is delivered from within Burma despite increasing restrictions.

I also understand that USAID continues to provide emergency and \\nnon-emergency food assistance to displaced populations and newly emerging areas \\nof violence. \\nRESPONSES TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD \\nSUBMITTED TO NATHANIEL FICK BY SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ \\nCHIPS+ Funding \\nQuestion. Last week Congress passed the CHIPS Act which includes a provision \\nthat allocates $500 million over 5 years to the Department of State which in coordi-\\nnation with USAID the Ex-Im Bank and the DFC will be used for a CHIPS for \\nAmerica International Technology Security and Innovation Fund. The purpose of \\nthis funding would be to coordinate with partner countries \\u2018\\u2018to support international \\ninformation and communications technology security.\\u2019\\u2019 and \\u2018\\u2018.the development and \\nadoption of secure and trusted telecommunications technologies secure semiconduc-\\ntors secure semiconductors supply chains and other emerging technologies.\\u2019\\u2019 \\n\\u2022 Will you commit to keeping this committee fully and currently informed about \\nthe use of this funding? \\nAnswer. Yes. The CHIPS for America International Technology Security and Inno-\\nvation Fund provides critical funding for international information communications \\ntechnology security and semiconductor supply chain activities. If confirmed I will \\ncommit to keep the Congressional stakeholders fully briefed on how the Department \\nplans to use the CHIPS funding as well as provide regular program status updates. \\nQuestion. What would be the CDP Bureau\\u2019s top priorities when using this fund-\\ning? \\nAnswer. The Department will support the use of CHIPS funding to promote semi-\\nconductor supply chain security and international information and communications \\ntechnology (ICT) security aligned with the Administration\\u2019s priorities. If confirmed \\nI would recommend prioritizing activities that promote cooperation on semicon-\\nductor supply chain activities with our allies and partners and encourage and \\nincentivize countries around the world to choose trustworthy suppliers for their \\nnext-generation telecommunications network build outs including for 5G. I would \\nalso work with allies and partners to promote a more diverse and resilient ICT sup-\\nply chain including through the promotion of new architectures such as Open Radio \\nAccess Networks. \\nNational Security Presidential Memorandum 13 \\nQuestion. In 2018 the Trump administration issued National Security Presi-\\ndential Memorandum 13 laying out U.S. Cyber Operations Policy including the ap-\\nproval process for conducting offensive and defense cyber operations outside the \\nUnited States. \\n\\u2022 If confirmed will you commit to ensuring that the appropriate Senate Foreign \\nRelations Committee staff gains access to this document? \\nAnswer. I respect the committee\\u2019s important oversight role in U.S. offensive and \\ndefensive cyber operations.

Just two weeks ago CISA opened its first attache\\n\\u00b4 office in London to \\n\\u2018\\u2018serve as a focal point for international collaboration between CISA UK Govern-\\nment officials and other federal agency officials\\u2019\\u2019 and the agency continues to enter \\ninto memoranda of cooperation with foreign governments such as Ukraine in July \\n2022. \\n\\u2022 Given these developments how do you envision the CDP Bureau\\u2019s relationship \\nthe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) evolving in the \\nnear and long-term? Where do you view your areas of responsibility beginning \\nand ending? \\nAnswer. The Department of State facilitates engagements between foreign govern-\\nments and U.S. agencies with specific technical expertise including through Embas-\\nsies overseas. Many countries want to work with and learn from CISA particularly \\nbecause it houses the best-in-class computer security incident response team with \\nnational responsibility. If confirmed I would look to continue the Department\\u2019s \\nstrong collaborative relationship with CISA leveraging their expertise to help part-\\nners gain the capabilities for better incident response and critical infrastructure pro-\\ntection including by working with the Department\\u2019s cyber officers at our diplomatic \\nmissions as I believe is intended by CISA\\u2019s Global Strategy. \\nDigital Freedom and Human Rights \\nQuestion. There is some concern that two subunits of the CDP Bureau\\u2014Inter-\\nnational Cyberspace Security and International Information and Communications \\nPolicy\\u2014will be headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary whereas the Digital Free-\\ndom Unit\\u2014the unit tasked to \\u2018\\u2018defend against efforts to legitimize and adopt repres-\\nsive and authoritarian practices in cyberspace\\u2019\\u2019\\u2014is led by a coordinator with little \\nsupport. \\nQuestion. Given this organizational structure how do you plan to elevate the \\nissue of human rights in the new Bureau? Given that the Digital Freedom Unit is \\nstill located within DRL how will do you plan to work with DRL on these issues? \\nAnswer. CDP and DRL are collaborative partners with complementary missions. \\nDRL continues to lead the Department\\u2019s work on Internet freedom to ensure that \\nindividuals can enjoy their human rights online as well as offline. CDP has an inte-\\ngrated mandate to lead on digital freedom which provides a broader paradigm to \\naddress the intersection between technology and human rights at a time when tech-\\nnology continues to expand into new areas of our lives. If confirmed I will empower \\nCDP\\u2019s Digital Freedom Team to promote meaningful access to digital technologies \\nin order to preserve cyber stability and guard against digital authoritarianism by \\ncoordinating on these issues across all Department equities and engaging the inter-\\nagency international partners and the multistakeholder community. I will ensure \\nthat the Digital Freedom Team receives the resources it needs to lead on this issue \\nincluding recognition of the Senior Coordinator as a Deputy Assistant Secretary \\nequivalent. \\nQuestion. While the Department of State has sought to centralize responsibility \\nfor its cyber diplomacy related activities in the new CDP Bureau the Bureaus of \\nDemocracy Human Rights and Labor and International Narcotics and Law En-\\nforcement Affairs will continue to have policy and programmatic responsibility for \\nissues related to internet freedom and cybercrime. \\n\\u2022 How will you ensure coherent State Department engagement on these and other \\nissues where there is a division of responsibilities across bureaus? \\nAnswer. Before the establishment of the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy \\nits component offices successfully navigated the division of responsibilities regarding \\nthe leadership of the Internet freedom and cybercrime portfolios. If confirmed I will \\ncontinue to maintain the close collaborative and functional partnership between \\nthe CDP Bureau DRL and INL while ensuring that I bring the economic national \\nsecurity and digital freedom perspectives together to advance a future where every-\\none everywhere can harness the benefits of an open Internet and digital tech-\\nnologies to reach their full potential. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00102\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n103 \\nU.S. Leadership at Standards-Setting Bodies (ITU) \\nQuestion. Part of the mission of the Bureau for Cyberspace and Digital Diplomacy \\nis \\u2018\\u2018to advance policies that protect the integrity and security of the infrastructure \\nof the internet.\\u2019\\u2019 I included a provision in my Economic Statecraft for the 21st Cen-\\ntury bill that would establish an interagency working group dedicated to enhancing \\nU.S. leadership and representation at international standards-setting bodies such as \\nthe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which establishes international \\nstandards that are fundamental to the operation for today\\u2019s information and com-\\nmunications technology networks. In the upcoming fall 2022 ITU Plenipotentiary \\nConference two candidates one from the United States and one from Russia are \\nrunning for the position of ITU Secretary General and represent fundamental dif-\\nferences in their views on digital governance. \\n\\u2022 What is the Administration doing to ensure that the United States is rep-\\nresented not only in top-level positions at the ITU such as Secretary General \\nbut also at the ITU\\u2019s lower-level workshops seminars and study groups which \\nis where recommendations and resolutions are sent up to the larger ITU body \\nfor votes? \\nAnswer. Responsible forward-looking and transparent leadership of the ITU is \\nvital to the U.S. telecommunications industry. The U.S. nomination of Doreen \\nBogdan-Martin as ITU Secretary-General is a critical piece of ensuring this strong \\nleadership. Ms. Bogdan-Martin has spent the last 28 years in the ITU working her \\nway up the ranks demonstrating how support for candidates at all levels is a win-\\nning strategy. If confirmed I will work to ensure continued coordination with \\nlikeminded partners in promoting leadership candidates including those of lower- \\nlevel working groups and study groups to promote fair transparent and consensus- \\nbased approach to ITU\\u2019s work on spectrum standards and telecommunications de-\\nvelopment. The Department recognizing that vote splitting contributes to undesir-\\nable results coordinates with allies and partners to maximize our chance of elec-\\ntoral victory. I thank Senator Risch for his report entitled \\u2018\\u2018A Concrete Agenda for \\nTransatlantic Cooperation on China\\u2019\\u2019 that reaffirms the importance of coordination. \\nDigital Authoritarianism and Cyber Sovereignty \\nQuestion. Governments such as China and Russia have promoted the concept of \\n\\u2018\\u2018cyber sovereignty\\u2019\\u2019 in international fora in order to justify more restrictive meas-\\nures on the Internet including surveillance and censorship of political activists. \\n\\u2022 Please describe your views on \\u2018\\u2018cyber sovereignty\\u2019\\u2019 and its implications for global \\ninternet governance. \\nAnswer. The concept of \\u2018\\u2018cyber sovereignty\\u2019\\u2019 being advanced by countries like Rus-\\nsia and China has the potential to erode the current multistakeholder model of glob-\\nal Internet governance and the benefits of a global distributed Internet for all. Pro-\\nponents of \\u2018\\u2018cyber sovereignty\\u2019\\u2019 are engaging in restrictive measures-such as \\nsurveilling and censoring their citizens and activists-or seeking to bring the Internet \\nunder greater inter-governmental control such as through the UN. For decades the \\nmultistakeholder model has underpinned the Internet\\u2019s global growth and its suc-\\ncess as a platform for free communication ensuring that no single entity\\u2014govern-\\nmental or otherwise\\u2014controls the Internet. If confirmed I will uphold the U.S. vi-\\nsion of the open interoperable secure and reliable Internet under the global multi-\\nstakeholder model and will oppose efforts to undermine it. \\nTransparency for \\u2018\\u2018Hunt Forward\\u2019\\u2019 Operations \\nQuestion. According to National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone \\u2018\\u201850 dif-\\nferent hunt forward operations were conducted in 16 countries over the past three \\nyears\\u2019\\u2019 all being \\u2018\\u2018instances where countries invite CYBERCOM to test their systems \\nagainst theoretical attacks.\\u2019\\u2019 One of the recommendations made in a report you co- \\nchaired for the Council on Foreign Relations titled \\u2018\\u2018Confronting Reality in Cyber-\\nspace: Foreign Policy for a Fragmented Internet\\u2019\\u2019 was \\u2018\\u2018to adopt great transparency \\nabout defend forward actions.\\u2019\\u2019 \\n\\u2022 If confirmed as the principal cyberspace policy official within the Department \\nof State how do you intend to work towards greater transparency for \\u2018\\u2018hunt for-\\nward\\u2019\\u2019 operations? \\nAnswer. As the report recommends proactive transparency and information shar-\\ning could give the United States first-mover advantages in the information space. \\nU.S. statements on self-restraint and defensive initiatives should be part of our \\nstrategy to disrupt and mitigate adversarial cyber operations below the level of \\narmed conflict.

Will you commit to consulting with this committee on significant devel-\\nopments and decisions with respect to the planned Special Envoy for Critical and \\nEmerging Technologies? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I anticipate that I will work in close collaboration with the \\nplanned Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology. The State Department \\nteam will continue to keep the committee informed about the planned Office of the \\nSpecial Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology. \\nIT Workforce and Tech Talent Pipeline \\nQuestion. Given that approximately 700000 cybersecurity roles remain vacant in \\nthe United States it is clear that our country faces a growing national security chal-\\nlenge when it comes to cybersecurity. The Biden administration underscored the ur-\\ngency of this issue in July 2022 by convening the National Cyber Workforce and \\nEducation Summit. Similarly the Department of State faces its own IT workforce \\nchallenges. In a GAO report published in April 2022 GAO states that \\u2018\\u2018State has \\nnot recruited continuously year-round for most of its IT positions or regularly as-\\nsessed its staffing needs.\\u2019\\u2019 Additional challenges include \\u2018\\u2018shortage of talent in pipe-\\nline and higher attrition rates compared to new hires\\u2019\\u2019 and limited training and ca-\\nreer development opportunities.\\u2019\\u2019 While the Under Secretary of Management nor-\\nmally addresses some of these issues the Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy \\nfor evident reasons has a vested interest in a strong viable IT workforce comprised \\nof top tech talent. You touched on this in your confirmation hearing when you said \\nthat you \\u2018\\u2018can imagine a future where any candidate to be a chief of mission is ex-\\npected to have an understanding of these issues.\\u2019\\u2019 \\n\\u2022 If confirmed what will you do to ensure that the Department is recruiting and \\nretaining IT talent as effectively as possible? How do you envision the Bureau \\nof Cyberspace and Digital Policy\\u2019s involvement in this process? \\nAnswer. The CDP Bureau provides opportunities for all Department employees to \\nlearn about cyber and digital policy issues. For example CDP provides training \\ncourses on International Digital Economy Policy and Cyber Diplomacy at the For-\\neign Service Institute which are open to all direct-hire employees posted in Wash-\\nington and overseas. If confirmed I will work to expand those opportunities. Equal-\\nly I will encourage CDP staff to leverage opportunities inside and outside the De-\\npartment to improve their own expertise on information and communications tech-\\nnology. I also pledge to work closely with the Bureau of Global Talent Management \\nto recruit retain train and sustain a diverse talented and inclusive workforce. \\nLikewise I will advocate in the U.S. business and technology communities to en-\\ncourage Americans with technology expertise to spend time in public service and am \\neager to support government-wide efforts to make it easier for mid-career Americans \\nto serve. \\nQuestion. How do you plan to ensure that the Department of State has a diverse \\nregional/demographic reach for tech talent? \\nAnswer. I support the Department of State\\u2019s commitment to building a workforce \\nthat reflects our nation\\u2019s diversity and leverages the creativity of diverse talented \\ngroups to advance the United States\\u2019 foreign policy priorities. As I stated in my con-\\nfirmation hearing my first priority is building the team and culture at the Bureau \\nto enable its long-term success. My hope is that the Bureau\\u2019s workforce will increas-\\ningly become the hub for international cyberspace and digital policy integrating na-\\ntional security economic prosperity and human rights. Achieving this aspiration \\nwill demand that we recruit and retain talent from the entire national talent pool\\u2014 \\nacross geography and across demography. If confirmed I would welcome the oppor-\\ntunity to work with the Bureau of Information Resource Management and the Bu-\\nreau of Global Talent Management\\u2019s Diplomats in Residence\\u2014career Foreign Serv-\\nice Officers and Specialists located throughout the United States who provide guid-\\nance and advice on careers internships and fellowships to students and profes-\\nsionals in the communities they serve\\u2014to ensure the Department has a diverse \\nworkforce. \\nQuestion.

RISCH \\nQuestion. How can the U.S. re-establish credible deterrence in cyberspace? \\nAnswer. Effectively shaping adversary decision-making requires the thoughtful \\napplication of all the tools of national power including diplomacy. If confirmed I \\nlook forward to working with Congress and my executive branch colleagues to re-\\ndouble U.S. efforts to achieve a significant long-lasting reduction in destructive dis-\\nruptive or otherwise destabilizing malicious cyber activities directed against U.S. \\ninterests. If confirmed I will lead U.S. diplomatic efforts to build a broad-based vol-\\nuntary coalition of likeminded states that can organize cooperative responses to sig-\\nnificant cyber incidents together ensuring that there are consequences for unaccept-\\nable cyber activity and in this way shaping adversaries\\u2019 decision-making. Within \\nthe U.S. interagency if confirmed I will work to strengthen collaboration between \\nthe Departments of State and Defense to include increasing cooperation around \\ncyber operations. These efforts will complement and be strengthened by CDP\\u2019s posi-\\ntive agenda grounded in U.S. values to promote the use of digital technologies for \\nthe benefit of all people everywhere. \\nAnswer. What role should the cyber bureau play in these efforts? \\nAnswer. Effectively shaping adversary decision-making requires the thoughtful \\napplication of all the tools of national power including diplomacy as well as other \\ncapabilities our interagency partners can bring to bear. If confirmed I will collabo-\\nrate with the interagency and lead U.S. diplomatic efforts to build a broad-based \\nvoluntary coalition of likeminded states that can organize cooperative responses to \\nsignificant cyber incidents together ensuring that there are appropriate con-\\nsequences for unacceptable cyber activity and in this way shaping adversaries\\u2019 deci-\\nsion-making. Such cooperative responses build on and create accountability for ad-\\nhering to the international consensus around the framework of responsible state be-\\nhavior in cyberspace. If confirmed I will continue the Department\\u2019s work to promote \\nthis framework and support its implementation across the globe. \\nQuestion. Will you commit to working with the committee on this issue? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work with the committee to explore development of \\na streamlined authority to allow sharing of critical cyber capabilities and informa-\\ntion with key operational partners. \\nQuestion. What efforts will you take to help ensure the CDP bureau is capable \\nof attract and retain the nation\\u2019s foremost digital and cyberspace talent? \\nAnswer. The CDP Bureau must operate like a 21st-century talent organization. \\nThis means that its success depends not upon a patent or process innovation or a \\nmarket monopoly but upon a continuous ability to recruit and retain a broad team \\nof talented people who have many other options for where to spend their profes-\\nsional time and energy. The Bureau\\u2019s great advantage in doing so is the power and \\nimportance of its mission. We will need to make the case\\u2014inside the Department \\nacross the interagency and outside the Government\\u2014that technology is the next \\nfrontier of diplomacy that these issues are fundamental to the future of American \\npower and competitiveness and that public service is a noble and rewarding pur-\\nsuit. If confirmed I will encourage Department employees to come spend time in \\nthe Bureau will commit to supporting members of the CDP Bureau team in gaining \\nas much professional training as possible and will do my utmost to build and sus-\\ntain a culture that empowers them and enables them to succeed. I pledge to work \\nclosely with the Bureau of Global Talent Management to recruit retain train and \\nsustain a diverse talented and inclusive workforce. Likewise I will advocate in the \\nU.S. business and technology communities to encourage Americans with technology \\nexpertise to spend time in public service and I am eager to support government- \\nwide efforts to make it easier for mid-career Americans to serve. \\nQuestion. What role does multilateral cooperation have in countering malign cyber \\ninfluence (e.g. from the PRC Russian Federation and DPRK)? \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00105\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n106 \\nAnswer. The United States\\u2019 work in international and multilateral organizations \\nhas led to international consensus on a framework of responsible state behavior in \\ncyberspace. All UN member states have committed to act in accordance with this \\nframework. While such a framework is not self-reinforcing it sets the foundation \\nupon which we can rally likeminded partners to hold irresponsible state actors ac-\\ncountable including through public attributions diplomatic actions and other re-\\nsponses. Likeminded partners have grown increasingly willing to take such action \\nin response to malign cyber influence. If confirmed I will continue to press for \\nprogress with our partners in countering malign cyber influence and promoting a \\nrights-respecting cyber and digital policy agenda. \\nQuestion. How will the Department of State integrate the Bureau for Cyberspace \\nand Digital Policy with other functional and regional bureaus? \\nAnswer. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy brings together into a single \\nentity the economic national security and human rights considerations regarding \\ncyberspace and digital technologies. In doing so the Bureau not only integrates its \\napproach to these issues internally and thereby advances Secretary Blinken\\u2019s mod-\\nernization agenda but also is well placed to play a coordinating role within the De-\\npartment and across the interagency. If confirmed I will build an organization that \\nelevates cyber and digital issues in U.S. foreign policy and maximizes our engage-\\nment with regional and functional bureaus to strengthen diplomacy as a tool to \\nachieve our national objectives on cyber and digital issues. \\nQuestion. Do you anticipate working closely with other U.S. Government agencies? \\nIf so which? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work to build an organization that can elevate cyber \\nand digital issues within U.S. foreign policy and maximize our engagement with \\ninteragency partners including the Department of Defense U.S. Agency for Inter-\\nnational Development Department of Homeland Security National Security Coun-\\ncil Office of the National Cyber Director Department of Justice Federal Commu-\\nnications Commission and Department of Commerce. In leveraging the expertise of \\nthese departments and agencies the Bureau can strengthen diplomacy as a tool to \\nachieve our national objectives on cyber and digital issues. \\nQuestion. Do you work with cyber/digital trafficking? \\nAnswer. Trafficking is a particularly heinous misuse of the Internet. If confirmed \\nI pledge to redouble our efforts working with the Bureau of International Narcotics \\nand Law Enforcement and the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons \\nas well as our partners at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of In-\\nvestigation to ensure U.S. diplomacy maintains clear focus on the prevention of dig-\\nital trafficking. \\nQuestion. In what capacity will you engage with the \\u2018\\u2018deep web?\\u2019\\u2019 \\nAnswer. Recognizing the gravity of cybercrime and the importance the United \\nStates places on combatting it if confirmed I will coordinate within the Department \\nand with our partners in law enforcement to ensure U.S. diplomacy complements \\nother U.S. Government efforts to reduce the threat of international cybercrime \\nwherever it occurs including the \\u2018\\u2018deep web.\\u2019\\u2019 \\nQuestion. How is the department working towards bolstering public/private part-\\nnerships such that innovation in cyberspace is encouraged? \\nAnswer. The Department of State advances U.S. foreign policy priorities through \\nprivate sector engagement including by cultivating cross-sector partnerships. Suc-\\ncessful partnerships of this nature will be a necessary element of the Bureau of \\nCyberspace and Digital Policy\\u2019s overall success given the concentration of talent \\nand technical capacity in the U.S. innovation economy. If confirmed I look forward \\nto working to leverage the Department\\u2019s various mechanisms tools and networks \\nto strengthen partnerships with the private sector on cyber and digital issues. We \\nneed to continue to foster an open enabling environment to encourage future inno-\\nvation aligned with U.S. values. \\nQuestion. \\u2033Upholding democratic values\\u2033 is one of CDP\\u2019s stated goals; which spe-\\ncific regions or nations does it have in mind? \\nAnswer. The U.S. Government works closely with allies and partners around the \\nworld including members of the Freedom Online Coalition and partners who affirm \\nthe Declaration of the Future of the Internet to uphold democratic values globally. \\nThe United States works to deter and respond to transnational repression and dig-\\nital authoritarianism by promoting digital freedom in accordance with the U.S. val-\\nues of openness and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

What role do you envision the CDP bureau playing in ensuring the \\nUnited States maintains global leadership in developing artificial intelligence ma-\\nchine learning and other emergent technologies? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I envision the CDP Bureau working alongside the Office of \\nthe Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology to continue to lead the De-\\npartment\\u2019s engagement in many international venues where artificial intelligence \\npolicy issues are discussed such as through bilateral dialogues at the Organization \\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development Global Partnership on AI Group of \\nSeven (G7) Group of Twenty (G20) U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council Quad-\\nrilateral Security Dialogue and International Telecommunication Union. The \\nUnited States can both further our technological capabilities and promote demo-\\ncratic values and human rights by working with our partners and allies to promote \\nthe responsible stewardship of trustworthy artificial intelligence and machine learn-\\ning. \\nQuestion. How will CDP collaborate with other agencies and departments in their \\nexisting research? \\nAnswer. Research related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning as \\ntechnologies with cross-cutting implications across policy areas is discussed in \\nmany bilateral and multilateral settings. If confirmed my vision is that CDP will \\ncontinue close collaboration with other agencies and departments in their existing \\nresearch by coordinating U.S. participation in those dialogues. In addition CDP \\nworks alongside the Office of the Science and Technology Advisor and Bureau of \\nOceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs to co-lead the De-\\npartment of State\\u2019s participation in the National Science and Technology Council\\u2019s \\nsubcommittee on Machine Learning and AI. \\nQuestion. How will CDP maintain an understanding of emergent technology \\ngiven its rapid pace of development? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work to ensure CDP maintains an understanding of \\nemergent technology by doing many of the same things I did while leading a cut-\\nting-edge technology company: leveraging internal expertise within our organization \\nclose collaboration with other relevant agencies and departments and regular con-\\nsultations with industry academia and civil society experts. I will work to increase \\nour internal expertise through new hires and access to increased training opportuni-\\nties. CDP also has the benefit of the Department\\u2019s network of embassies and con-\\nsulates to maintain an understanding of international developments and other coun-\\ntries\\u2019 approaches to emergent technology. \\nQuestion. Are there any emergent technologies that the CDP sees utility or poten-\\ntial in? \\nAnswer. Yes CDP sees utility and potential in many emerging technologies and \\ntheir applications including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning Inter-\\nnet of Things blockchain Web 3.0 6G and Open RAN architecture. Advances in \\nemergent technologies present great opportunities in addition to great challenges. \\nIf confirmed I will work with allies and partners companies universities and civil \\nsociety organizations that promote democratic values and share a commitment to \\ndesign and deploy technology for the benefit of all people. \\nQuestion. If confirmed how would you engage with allies and partners to promote \\nCyber policies consistent with U.S. values? \\nAnswer. The Department is on the frontlines of the U.S. Government\\u2019s efforts to \\npromote meaningful access to digital technologies maintain an open interoperable \\nsecure and reliable Internet and preserve a stable cyberspace by defending against \\nchallenges such as digital authoritarianism. These efforts are central to the Bureau \\nof Cyberspace and Digital Policy\\u2019s mission. Digitally repressive regimes and foreign \\nadversaries often seek to harness digital technologies to control domestic popu-\\nlations through a sprawling system of censorship surveillance and Internet restric-\\ntions. These efforts also extend outward through transnational repression of dias-\\npora communities and other critics abroad and the export of authoritarian goals \\nthrough trade relationships the UN and other multilateral fora and standard-set-\\nting bodies. If confirmed I will lead CDP in sustaining and building partnerships \\nto defend against these efforts and ensure U.S. diplomacy advances digital tech-\\nnologies that support democracy and human rights. \\nQuestion.

If confirmed I will work with interagency partners to increase alignment \\nbetween U.S. public and private entities and the U.S. national cyber security strat-\\negy and policy priorities. U.S. companies have a major role in advancing an open \\ninteroperable secure and reliable Internet and should not be complicit in enabling \\nthe use of technology in ways that violate human rights and democratic values. \\nQuestion. Would you directly address foreign countries restricting internet free-\\ndoms in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights? \\nAnswer. Yes. The Department of State monitors and responds to laws policies \\nand activities that restrict human rights online and works to address all concerns \\nthrough appropriate bilateral and multilateral channels and public diplomacy. The \\nDepartment consistently seeks to advance Internet freedom through UN bodies the \\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development the Group of Seven (G7) \\nand other international organizations. The U.S. Government also plays a global \\nleadership role in multi-stakeholder initiatives focused on Internet freedom and \\nhuman rights online such as the Freedom Online Coalition (FOC). The FOC has \\nbeen instrumental in building cross-regional coalitions to support Internet freedom. \\nThe United States will take over the chairmanship of the FOC in 2023 as part of \\nour commitment to bolstering its work in the Summit for Democracy\\u2019s Presidential \\nInitiative for Democratic Renewal. If confirmed I will continue to carry forward and \\nexpand upon this vital work in coordination with the Bureau of Democracy Human \\nRights and Labor. \\nQuestion. Please describe your assessment of global internet freedom and the U.S. \\nGovernment\\u2019s response to a rising authoritarian threat off and online. \\nAnswer. I am concerned by the decline in Internet freedom globally including \\nthrough the misuse of digital technologies. Preventing the misuse of digital tech-\\nnologies including by authoritarian governments is a core priority for the United \\nStates. This topic is being addressed bilaterally and in coordination with partners \\nand allies via the Summit for Democracy U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council \\nFreedom Online Coalition and elsewhere. For example the U.S. Government con-\\ntinues to work through the Summit for Democracy to take action including estab-\\nlishing a code of conduct on how export controls can be used to address the pro-\\nliferation of technologies conducive to human rights abuses. Additionally the De-\\npartment intends to bolster U.S. global leadership on Internet freedom issues \\nthrough our chairmanship of the Freedom Online Coalition in 2023. If confirmed \\nI will continue to carry this work forward. \\nQuestion. How can you if confirmed best streamline current U.S. Government ef-\\nforts to promote global internet freedom? \\nAnswer. Promoting Internet freedom is an essential part of the U.S. Government\\u2019s \\napproach to protecting and promoting human rights. The Department of State leads \\nthe U.S. Government\\u2019s efforts to promote respect for human rights globally includ-\\ning online by raising these concerns bilaterally building and participating in multi-\\nlateral and multi-stakeholder coalitions focused on advancing human rights online \\nglobally and funding civil society-led policy and advocacy projects that promote \\nInternet freedom. If confirmed I will strengthen coordination within the Depart-\\nment and across the interagency to ensure the U.S. Government has an integrated \\ncohesive policy on initiatives to promote Internet freedom that guard against the \\nrise of digital authoritarianism. \\nQuestion. Will you also plan to push back against proposals from allies or tech \\ncompanies that promote censorship or other restrictions on the freedom of speech? \\nAnswer. Some countries attempt to regulate social media to stifle freedom of ex-\\npression target activists or limit access to independent journalism. The United \\nStates responds to these actions with diplomatic engagement that advocates for re-\\nspecting human rights and fundamental freedoms both online and offline including \\nin response to content issues. The Department encourages Internet service pro-\\nviders including social media platforms to consider their commitments under the \\nUN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and their own terms of serv-\\nice.

If confirmed do you commit to working with relevant bureaus and agen-\\ncies to promoting text that promotes American values and national security inter-\\nests in the treaty? \\nAnswer. Yes. While the current process was initiated by Russia they are not lead-\\ning this process. Instead the United States is leading a broad and diverse group \\nof experts in debates on the technical merits of an international instrument focused \\non cybercrime.

MARKEY \\nQuestion. How will your private sector experience enhance your effectiveness in \\nstrengthening opportunities for public-private partnerships to advance U.S. foreign \\npolicy goals in the areas of cyberspace and digital policy? \\nAnswer. The United States has long championed the importance of a multistake-\\nholder approach to address cyber and digital policy. This is essential given the con-\\ncentration of talent and technical capacity in the U.S. innovation economy. Accord-\\ningly successful public-private partnerships are a necessary element of CDP\\u2019s over-\\nall success. If confirmed I look forward to identifying opportunities to support both \\nnew and continued partnerships with the private sector. If confirmed I will explore \\na range of options including using blended finance programs to attract private in-\\nvestment in critical technologies incorporating additional expertise from industry in \\nCDP-funded trainings and workshops and meeting with global technology business \\nleaders to explain CDP\\u2019s priorities. \\nQuestion. Under your leadership what principles will govern the Bureau of Cyber-\\nspace and Digital Policy\\u2019s engagement with civil society organizations and partici-\\npants in other countries who are pushing back against digital authoritarianism and \\nadvocating for democracy human rights and fundamental freedoms? \\nAnswer. Digital transformation presents great promise for collaboration commu-\\nnication and innovation for billions of people. As millions more come online each \\nday to maximize the opportunities for their livelihoods their societal engagements \\nand their prosperity they also face potential risks of exclusion harm and the exten-\\nsion of offline inequalities to online disparities. If confirmed I will ensure that the \\nBureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy\\u2019s engagement on digital freedom is coordi-\\nnated with key stakeholders within the Department interagency and international \\ncommunity including the private sector and civil society. I will make sure the bu-\\nreau\\u2019s work in this space is guided by and consistent with the United States\\u2019 obliga-\\ntions under domestic and international law and U.S. policy and commitments in-\\ncluding the principles outlined in the founding documents of the Freedom Online \\nCoalition as well as the Biden-Harris administration\\u2019s trademark initiatives on \\ntechnology and democracy such as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet. \\nQuestion. The Declaration for the Future of the Internet is an important step in \\nobtaining the commitment of governments to fundamental values including privacy \\nand respect for human rights. What actions will you take to increase the number \\nof signatories and encourage more governments to commit to the Declaration\\u2019s vi-\\nsion of an open free global interoperable reliable and secure Internet? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will work closely with likeminded partners to promote the \\nprinciples of the Declaration for the Future of the Internet (DFI) encourage addi-\\ntional governments to join and operationalize its commitments in concrete ways. \\nFor example we will use joint demarches with appropriate partner governments to \\npersuade countries that have not yet joined to do so.

Is the Chinese Communist Party a threat to the United States? \\nAnswer. The next ten years may be the decisive decade in the competition be-\\ntween the United States and the PRC. As I stated in my confirmation hearing \\u2018\\u2018Our \\nstrategic competition with China along digital lines is probably the most defining \\nstrategic question of my generation. We have a competitor out there with a very dif-\\nferent view of what our global technology future should look like.\\u2019\\u2019 If confirmed I \\nwill help advance the Biden-Harris administration\\u2019s comprehensive whole-of-gov-\\nernment strategy to compete responsibly with the PRC while highlighting with al-\\nlies and partners our vision for an open interoperable reliable and secure Internet \\nas a key enabler of global freedom and prosperity. \\nQuestion. Does the Chinese Communist Party undertake any activities that are \\nbeneficial to U.S. interests? \\nAnswer. As Secretary Blinken has said we will cooperate with the PRC where \\nour interests align. However the CCP\\u2019s authoritarian vision for cyberspace tele-\\ncommunications digital governance and emerging technology is not one of these \\nareas. If confirmed I will focus on addressing the risks to the United States our \\npartners and our allies\\u2014and to an open interoperable reliable and secure Inter-\\nnet\\u2014that would come from having the rules of the road set by a country that does \\nnot share our core values. \\nQuestion. If confirmed will you approve any joint activity with organizations or \\nrepresentatives from the People\\u2019s Republic of China as part of your work? \\nAnswer. The United States will continue to engage with the PRC in forums where \\nthe PRC and the United States are both members like APEC and the ASEAN Re-\\ngional Forum. The United States will also continue bilateral diplomatic engagement \\nto further its interests in multilateral fora. By including all stakeholders in stand-\\nards-developing organizations (SDOs) the resulting standards reflect a private sec-\\ntor-led consensus-based bottom-up approach that has been the key to our efforts \\nto promote a democratic rules-based system. Their inclusion also avoids the cre-\\nation of a parallel SDO structure in which the PRC is able to promote its model \\nto smaller countries unopposed. If confirmed I will pursue bilateral engagement \\nwith the PRC on topics and in organizations in which we have shared interests. \\nQuestion. Are you aware of the danger posed to these activists by the Chinese \\nCommunist Party? If so what can be done to limit this activity? \\nAnswer. I am concerned about the threat posed by the People\\u2019s Republic of Chi-\\nna\\u2019s use of transnational repression. To address this threat the Biden-Harris ad-\\nministration is pursuing a multi-faceted strategy. The Department of State has \\nworked to increase awareness of resources available to assist targets of \\ntransnational repression at home and abroad to encourage open lines of commu-\\nnication between these individuals and the U.S. Government and to impose con-\\nsequences on PRC officials engaged in transnational repression. If confirmed I will \\nstrengthen partnerships with the private sector and our allies to counter PRC \\ntransnational repression through digital means and work to reduce the likelihood \\nthat U.S. partners facilitate PRC transnational repression. \\nQuestion. Many of these activists receive direct support and funding from the \\nState Department or from international organizations that receive U.S. Govern-\\nment funding. If confirmed what will you do to ensure that communication with \\nthese activists is not vulnerable to CCP cyberattacks? \\nAnswer. Safeguarding the activists human rights defenders and civil society or-\\nganizations who receive support and funding from U.S. Foreign Assistance requires \\nthat their security practices are guided by experts who understand the local context \\nand can track changes in those threat landscapes. This is true in many sensitive \\ncontexts including those at risk from digital threats stemming from the PRC. If con-\\nfirmed I will support ongoing and future U.S. Government efforts to raise aware-\\nness of digital risks to individuals at risk of being targeted by the PRC and work \\nwith others in the Department to provide digital safety training tools and mate-\\nrials to activists human rights defenders and civil society organizations at risk of \\ndigitally aided repression and online attacks.

If confirmed what will you do to work with social media companies and \\nother countries to ensure that activists at risk of transnational repression are not \\nvulnerable to CCP cyberattacks? \\nAnswer. If confirmed I will continue to maintain close contact with social media \\ncompanies and other digital platforms to raise awareness of transnational repres-\\nsion and to combat PRC malicious cyber activities disinformation and online har-\\nassment while emphasizing U.S. support for freedom of expression including online. \\nI will also work with other governments to raise awareness of and address \\nvulnerabilities to cyberattacks and other digital security risks to individuals who \\nmay be targeted for transnational repression. If confirmed I will work with others \\nin the Department and across the interagency to promote accountability for actors \\nwho facilitate transnational repression using the tools the Department has avail-\\nable including sanctions export controls and visa restrictions. \\nQuestion. In your opinion are American citizens\\u2019 communications with embassies \\nand consulates overseas protected from surveillance by the Chinese Communist \\nParty the Russian Federation Iran North Korea the Maduro Regime or Cuba? \\nPlease explain. \\nAnswer. The Department of State uses its resources to monitor all its embassies \\nand consulates for unauthorized surveillance including surveillance of communica-\\ntions between Department officials and American citizens. In the event that surveil-\\nlance is detected on Department infrastructure from an unauthorized actor Depart-\\nment officials work with federal law enforcement and intelligence partners to miti-\\ngate the effects of the intrusion. The Department uses information from these inci-\\ndents to improve its monitoring regime and better secure its communications and \\nIT infrastructure. If confirmed I will work with the Department colleagues charged \\nwith the protection of embassy and consulate communications to align where need-\\ned any resource requests and related foreign policy concerns. \\nQuestion. In your opinion are formal communications (i.e. visa applications other \\nconsular services) between third-country nationals and our embassy and consulates\\u2019 \\nConsular Affairs sections adequately protected from authoritarian regimes? \\nAnswer. Cybersecurity is one of the Department\\u2019s top priorities. The Bureau of \\nConsular Affairs (CA) manages a robust cybersecurity program closely linked to De-\\npartment and other interagency efforts. CA dedicates substantial resources and \\nhighly skilled personnel to continuously monitor test and implement upgrades to \\nDepartment systems to improve the U.S. defense against evolving cybersecurity \\nthreats. The Department\\u2019s network users\\u2014both domestic and overseas\\u2014undergo an-\\nnual training to recognize common scenarios and vulnerabilities such as spear \\nphishing so they can help defend these critical systems. If confirmed I will work \\nclosely with colleagues in CA to ensure that our efforts are integrated and well-sup-\\nported. \\nQuestion. What more can be done in this regard? \\nAnswer. The Bureau of Consular Affairs collaborates across its directorates and \\noffices and with other bureaus within the Department to strengthen the Depart-\\nment\\u2019s ability to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats to critical sys-\\ntems and networks before they can be exploited. Additionally Consular Affairs is \\nactively expanding its partnership with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-\\nrity Agency and other U.S. interagency partners to increase its security posture. At \\nthe individual level Consular Affairs promotes awareness and a shared sense of re-\\nsponsibility through scenario training debriefs and workshops and targeted secu-\\nrity awareness briefings to government and contract staff such as developers site \\nadministrators and application administrators in order to protect the privacy and \\nintegrity of the information entrusted to us by the traveling public. If confirmed I \\nwill work closely with Consular Affairs colleagues to support those efforts to \\nprioritize the awareness and security of U.S. citizens abroad. \\nQuestion. In your opinion are American travelers adequately informed of the data \\nsecurity risks when they travel to these countries or places in which these authori-\\ntarian regimes have a major presence? \\nAnswer. U.S. citizens are warned of security risks including threats to their data \\nand the threat of surveillance and monitoring through the Department\\u2019s Inter-\\nnational Travel\\u2014Country Information Pages on travel.state.gov. In addition U.S. \\nEmbassies may notify U.S. citizens of these threats through alerts and messages as \\nappropriate.

If confirmed I will work closely with colleagues throughout the De-\\npartment to ensure our policy and technical approaches are well-aligned so Amer-\\nican travelers can understand the importance of this issue. \\nQuestion. Should Americans have TikTok or other apps operated by companies \\nwith close ties to the Chinese Communist Party on their phones? Do these apps \\npose a risk? Please explain. \\nAnswer. I believe that apps from developers with close ties to the CCP do pose \\na privacy risk to their users. Personally I do not use them and I do my best to \\nprevent my children from using them. The Biden-Harris administration is com-\\nmitted to protecting Americans\\u2019 sensitive personal data in line with advancing our \\noverall national security interests as well as promoting longstanding foreign policy \\nobjectives such as the free flow of data with trust over an open interoperable se-\\ncure and reliable Internet. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy leads the \\nDepartment of State\\u2019s coordination on multiple lines of effort to strengthen the pro-\\ntection of American users\\u2019 data including data shared through phone applications \\nparticularly through the implementation of E.O. 14034 (\\u2018\\u2018Protecting Americans\\u2019 Sen-\\nsitive Data from Foreign Adversaries\\u2019\\u2019) and E.O. 13873 (\\u2018\\u2018Securing the Information \\nand Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain\\u2019\\u2019). If confirmed I will \\nensure the CDP Bureau works both internally and with the interagency as well as \\nwith like-minded allies and partners to carry out these efforts fully. \\nQuestion. Does the State Department keep a list of apps vulnerable to authori-\\ntarian surveillance and if so does it make American travelers aware of these apps? \\nAnswer. The State Department is involved in several interagency processes to \\nidentify risks to U.S. national security including authoritarian surveillance of U.S. \\nusers through social media applications through implementation of E.O. 14034 \\n(\\u2018\\u2018Protecting Americans\\u2019 Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries\\u2019\\u2019) and E.O. 13873 \\n(\\u2018\\u2018Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply \\nChain\\u2019\\u2019) led by the Department of Commerce. If confirmed I will work closely with \\ncolleagues in the Department and across the interagency to help ensure Americans \\nare aware of the risks posed by the use of certain digital technologies including \\napps. \\nQuestion. If confirmed what will you do to improve State Department policies to \\nprotect American travelers from authoritarian surveillance and cyber-attacks? \\nAnswer. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy is committed to strength-\\nening the Department of State\\u2019s policies and programming to address national secu-\\nrity challenges in cyberspace to protect U.S. citizens here and abroad. If confirmed \\nI commit to working with others in the Department the interagency and the inter-\\nnational community to continue to strengthen the U.S. culture of cybersecurity for \\nthe benefit of all users including by promoting awareness of cyber hygiene. \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00112\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n113 \\nCORRESPONDENCE I.\\u2014SUPPORTING THE NOMINATION OF NATHANIEL FICK TO BE \\nAMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR CYBERSPACE AND DIGITAL POLICY \\nSUBMITTED BY A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SECURITY AND INDUSTRY LEADERS \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00113\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-1.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n114 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00114\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-2.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n115 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00115\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-3.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n116 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00116\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-4.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n117 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00117\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-5.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n118 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00118\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-6.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n119 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00119\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-7.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n120 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00120\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-8.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n121 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00121\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFick-9.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n122 \\nCORRESPONDENCE II.\\u2014SUPPORTING THE NOMINATION OF NATHANIEL FICK TO BE \\nAMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE FOR CYBERSPACE AND DIGITAL POLICY \\nSUBMITTED BY CHRISTOPHER PAINTER FORMER COORDINATOR \\nFOR CYBER ISSUES U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00122\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFickII-1.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n123 \\nVerDate Mar 15 2010 \\n11:37 Feb 21 2023\\nJkt 000000\\nPO 00000\\nFrm 00123\\nFmt 6601\\nSfmt 6621\\nS:\\\\FULL COMMITTEE\\\\GPO FILES\\\\NOM.2DTOPRINT\\\\17 NOM. 08 03 2022\\\\AUG3.TXT\\nMIK\\nFickII-2.eps\\nFOREI-SURFAC-14 with DISTILLER\\n\",\n          \" \\nJanuary 9 2023 \\n \\nThe Honorable Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Albares \\nForeign Minister \\nSpanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs \\nPlaza del Marqu\\u00e9s de Salamanca 8 \\nMadrid Spain \\n \\nDear Foreign Minister Albares \\nI am writing to commend you and the S\\u00e1nchez government for your decision to stand with the \\nCuban people by denying 350000 Euros-worth of tear gas and other crowd control material to \\nthe Diaz-Canel regime in 2022.
